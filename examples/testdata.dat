                        NOTES ON DATAFILES

(1) Scope of test-data.

(a) The test-data in TESTDATA.DAT are intended to demonstrate some of the
    capabilities of MOPAC. 
(b) The test-data files are not designed for checking MOPAC for
    errors.
(c) Only the main paths through MOPAC are demonstrated. The large C.I.,
    MECI is used, but not all its features are demonstrated. Similarly,
    the DRC and polymer capabilities are not shown.  These were added
    too late for this set of tests.

(2) The test data are intended to be run as follows:

(a) Run first the single test-data file MNRSD1.DAT, the one described in
    the Manual. Check that the results are acceptable. Small differences
    in calculated quantities are to be expected due to different definitions
    of double precision numbers, and to minor changes made to MOPAC as a
    result of suggestions made by early users of MOPAC.
(b) The first file in TESTDATA.DAT is described in detail in the Manual,
    and can be used to demonstrate a full FORCE calculation.
    If desired, the calculation of this system can be delayed until
    after the next few tests.
(b) Run, in turn, the next four files in TESTDATA.DAT, these show the
    four main electronic pathways: the RHF closed-shell, the UHF open-shell,
    the RHF triplet open shell (does not use C.I.), and the RHF biradical
    (which does use C.I.). If any of these fail to run successfully, no
    associated geometric path will work. 
(c) The next four data files in TESTDATA demonstrate the geometric pathways.
    These are, in order, the FORCE calculation, which calculates force
    constants, vibrational frequencies, and thermodynamic quantities;
    the FORCE calculation being used with an ill-defined geometry (FORCE
    should only be used with systems at their stationary points, if it
    is not at a stationary point, Bartell's method will be used to optimise
    the geometry to the stationary point; this is normally less efficient 
    than using the D.F.P. method or SIGMA method); the SIGMA method for
    locating a stationary point (here the MINDO/3 geometry for formaldehyde
    is used to start a MNDO optimisation); and a Bartell's method
    optimisation.
      Bartell's and the SIGMA method are mainly used to locate transition
    states. Bartell's method will always work, but can be extremely slow
    at the end, and can locate a point of inflection if the initial geometry
    was very poor. SIGMA is slow to start, since it constructs a full Hessian,
    and will normally fail if the geometry is not near to a stationary point,
    but when it does work is very fast and accurate. Sometimes the results
    of a SIGMA optimization that failed are sufficiently good to act as
    data for a second SIGMA optimization that will work.
(d) The next two data files demonstrate the reaction options. The first
    is the "reaction" of one methyl group rotating relative to the other
    fixed methyl group in ethane. The other is the location of the transition
    state in classical ethyl cation hydrogen migrating from one carbon atom
    to the other.
(e) Finally, there is a demonstration of the location of a transition state,
    and its characterisation as a transition state via force constants.

(3) Initially, it is suggested that the testdata are used as "templates"
    for generating data. Users are recommended to experiment with 
    various combinations of key-words to their test understanding of MOPAC.
    To save time, small compounds, such as H2O and CO2 etc. are suggested
    as model systems.
