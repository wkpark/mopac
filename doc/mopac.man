      instructions as a guide to getting MOPAC up and running.                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
           (1) Put the magnetic tape on the tape drive, write protected.        
                                                                                
                                                                                
           (2) Allocate the tape drive with a command such as $ALLOCATE MTA0:   
                                                                                
                                                                                
           (3) Go into an empty directory which is to hold MOPAC                
                                                                                
                                                                                
           (4) Mount the magnetic tape with the command $MOUNT MTA0:  MOPAC     
                                                                                
                                                                                
           (5) Copy all the  files  from  the  tape  with  the  command  $COPY

           (6) A useful operation after this would be to make a hard  copy  of

      often they do not work.  If the gradient norm  is  low,  say  less  than  
                                                                                
      about  5  units,  then  SIGMA will probably work, in most cases NLLSQ is  
                                                                                
      recommended.  SIGMA first calculates a quite  accurate  Hessian  matrix,  
                                                                                
      this is a slow step, then works out the direction of fastest decent, and  
                                                                                
      searches along that direction until the gradient norm is minimised.  The  
                                                                                
      Hessian  is  then partially updated in light of the new gradients, and a  
                                                                                
      fresh search direction found.  Clearly, if the Hessian changes  markedly  
                                                                                
      as  a result of the line-search, the update done will be inaccurate, and  
                                                                                
      the new search direction will be faulty.                                  
                                                                                
                                                                                
           Of course,  SIGMA  should  be  avoided  if  at  all  possible  when

      In all geometric specifications care  must  be  taken  in  defining  the  
 internal  coordinates  to  ensure  that no three atoms being used to define a  
 fourth atom's dihedral angle ever fall into a straight line.  This can happen  
 in  the  course  of  a  geometry  optimisation, in a SADDLE calculation or in  
 following a reaction coordinate.If such a condition should develope, then the  
 position of the dependent atom would become ill-defined.

          second iteration over-compensates, and an oscillation is generated.

      can  equate these elements with the eigenvalues resulting from the exact

      appear to introduce errors in the final SCF density matrix, as obviously

      However,  to obtain a SCF density matrix we not only do not need to know

      will, of course, not exactly eliminate even those elements which  we  do

      problem comes to our rescue, and as the iterations proceed those  errors

      The problem is to determine how to modify the geometries of A and  B  in

      Since the centre of the hypersphere was at A, and A is normally far from

      since the geometry of B' is optimised, its energy  will  be  a  minimum,

      the energy of B will be less than that of  the  saddle  point,  and  the

      lower energy is normally further  from  the  transition  state,  if  the
