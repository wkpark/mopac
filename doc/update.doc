                                    INTRODUCTION

   

   

   

                             Introduction to MOPAC 6.0

                            for Experienced MOPAC Users

   

   

                                   Why Read This?

   

           Readers are assumed to  be  familiar  with  MOPAC  data  input  and

      output.  While the MOPAC 6.0 Manual contains a full description of these

      functions, experienced users can more easily learn about  MOPAC  6.0  by

      reference to the changes relative to MOPAC 5.0.  This document should be

      read once, then discarded.  Thereafter, reference to MOPAC 6.0 should be

      through the Manual or through the on-line HELP utility.

   

           Note that the Manual will  have  slightly  different  wording  from

      these upgrade notes:  the Manual is intended to be a reference document.

      These notes are intended to be read once only.

   

           Of paramount importance is the redefinition of the  keywords  DEBUG

      and 1SCF.

   

   

   

   

      1.1  REDEFINED KEYWORDS

   

           DEBUG:  Previously, DEBUG meant 'increase the amount of output when

      other keywords were used.' With the passage of time, more and more debug

      keywords have been defined.  Rather than define  all  allowed  keywords,

      existing debug keywords, such as FLEPO, LINMIN, etc.  have been removed,

      and are assumed to be debug keywords  if  'DEBUG'  is  specified.   Now,

      'DEBUG'  means  'all  unrecognized  keywords  are  assumed  to  be debug

      keywords'.  A few keywords,  such  as  VECTORS  and  DENSITY,  are  both

      recognized  and  debug  keywords:   recognized  to be both as legitimate

      keywords (VECTORS will cause the final eigenvectors to be printed),  and

      as  debug keywords, in that they cause increased diagnostic output to be

      generated when DEBUG is also used (VECTORS will cause  all  eigenvectors

      on every iteration to be printed).

   

           1SCF:  Previously,  1SCF  would  not  generate  derivatives  unless

      GRADIENTS  was  also  specified,  in  which  case  all  derivatives were

      generated.  This choice of function had been made because half  electron

      derivatives took so long.

   

           With the analytic C.I.  derivatives, the time constraint is lifted.

      In  order  to  accommodate the new Gaussian options a new definition for

      1SCF became desirable.

   

           1SCF Definition:  A single SCF calculation will be done.   If  GRAD

      is also specified, gradients for the marked parameters will be generated

      and printed.  Under no circumstances will optimization or symmetry  data

      be changed.

   

   

   

   

   

      1.2  GENERAL

   

           The new keyword SETUP is recommended for general  use.   The  SETUP

      file  should  contain all commonly-used keywords.  If the default values

      of criteria are  not  acceptable,  then  the  desired  criteria  can  be

      specified  in  SETUP.   Each  data-set  could  then use SETUP.  If, in a

      specific job, the defaults in SETUP need to be changed, then specify the

      the  new  value  on  the  keyword  line.  The order of priority is thus:

      keywords take priority over SETUP, which takes  priority  over  built-in

      default values.

   

   

                    CHANGES IN GOING FROM MOPAC 5.0 TO MOPAC 6.0

   

           The changes made to MOPAC 5.0 in order to create MOPAC 6.0  can  be

      divided  into  the  following groups:  (a) correction of faults in MOPAC

      5.0; (b) changes to increase the speed of execution; (c) minor  criteria

      and layout changes; (d) improved or new algorithms; (e) extension to new

      elements.

   

           The main change that users should be aware of  is  that  much  more

      control  over  the calculation has been made available to the user.  The

      keyword PRECISE is retained, but is not  recommended.   PRECISE  is  too

      heavy-handed.   Most  of  the time it is sufficient to tighten up one or

      two criteria, rather that tighten up everything.  In particular, PRECISE

      should not routinely be used in conjunction with FORCE.

   

           Other examples of increased user control:

                                    INTRODUCTION

   

   

           (a) In Version 5.0, if C.I.=4 was specified,  exactly  4  electrons

      were  involved  in  the  C.I.   In  Version 6.0, the user can select the

      number of electrons involved in the C.I.

   

           (b) In Version 5.0, users could not suppress  certain  output,  for

      example  the  DRC  geometries.   This frequently resulted in huge output

      files.  Version 6.0 gives  the  user  extensive  control  over  what  is

      printed in DRC's and IRC's.

   

           (c)  Additional  diagnostics  are  provided   to   allow   detailed

      monitoring of a calculation.

   

   

   

   

      1.3  CORRECTION OF FAULTS IN MOPAC 5.0

   

   

           1.  Force   constants   and   frequencies   calculated   using    a

               non-variationally optimized wavefunction were frequently faulty

               due to array overwrites.  This has  been  completely  reworked,

               and is now corrected.

   

           2.  When a text line was 'full', i.e.  no  double  spaces  and  the

               first  character  was not a space, MOPAC 5.00 would corrupt the

               last word.  This has  been  corrected  in  lines  2  and  3  by

               extending  the  strings  to  81  characters.   Line  1 has been

               completely re-defined (see later).

   

           3.  The torsion angle calculation was very  clumsy,  and  sometimes

               produced incorrect results.  This has been completely rewritten

               by Dr George Purvis III, of Tektronix, and is now 'bugfree'.

   

           4.  When PRECISE was used in a FORCE calculation  on  diatomic  and

               triatomic  systems,  the  trivial  modes had large frequencies.

               Constraints have now been placed  on  the  step  size  used  in

               calculating  the  Hessian.   Other  modes  were  not  affected.

               PRECISE is NOT recommended for use with FORCE calculations.

   

           5.  In FORCE  calculations  involving  large  numbers  of  hydrogen

               atoms,  the diagonalization would sometimes not work.  This bug

               was reported by Dr Yoshihisa Inoue of the Green Cross Corp.  of

               Osaka, Japan, along with a suggested fix.  The diagonalizer has

               been corrected, and such calculations should now work.

   

           6.  The EXTERNAL option would only work with AM1.  In Version  6.0,

               EXTERNAL will work with MNDO, AM1 and PM3.

   

           7.  In going from MOPAC  4.0  to  MOPAC  5.0,  an  error  had  been

               introduced   into  the  vibrational  transition  dipoles.   The

               magnitudes were wrong by about 30%.  This has been corrected in

   

                                        1-3

               Version 6.0.

   

           8.  In Version 5.0, if two atoms were  coincident,  then  a  divide

               error  would  occur.  This resulted in a job crash.  In Version

               6.0, those conditions  would  cause  an  error  message  to  be

               printed, and the run stopped.

   

   

   

   

   

   

      1.4  INCREASES IN EFFICIENCY

   

   

           1.  Where   possible,   the   finite-difference   derivatives    of

               non-variationally optimized wavefunctions (RHF open shell) have

               been replaced by the analytical derivatives described by  Dewar

               and  Liotard.   These are extremely fast compared with full SCF

               derivatives, and are normally highly accurate.  The derivatives

               can be used for all four Hamiltonians.

   

                    Limitations:  For reasons still unknown, if the  state  to

               be  optimized is very different from the ground state, then the

               computed  derivatives  have  unacceptably  large  errors.    To

               correct  this,  either  use  keyword  NOANCI or specify an open

               shell SCF wavefunction.   For  example,  to  optimize  the  9th

               excited state of formaldehyde, suitable keywords are "OPEN(2,3)

               C.I.=(3,0) ROOT=9" See also C.I.  (see later)

   

           2.  If, in a DRC, all forces on the atoms are  very  small  for  10

               consecutive steps (i.e.  the system has become quiescent), then

               the calculation will be stopped.

   

           3.  Prof Walter Thiel has proposed a new  strategy  for  optimizing

               geometries.   Some  of  his ideas have been incorporated into a

               new subroutine, FSTMIN, which replaces LINMIN.

   

           4.  Prof Peter Pulay's Geometric Direct Inversion of the  Iterative

               Subspace  technique  has been rendered into FORTRAN by Cummings

               and Gready.  Commings and Gready  volunteered  their  code  for

               incorporation  into  MOPAC.   The  G-DIIS  technique  does  not

               require  any  additional  function  evaluations,  and  is  thus

               'free'.  The implementation of the G-DIIS im MOPAC does not run

               as fast as that described by Cummings and Gready.  This is most

               likely  a  result  of  incorporating it into the existing MOPAC

               structure.

   

           5.  The two-electron two-center contributions to  the  Fock  matrix

               have been rewritten.

                                    INTRODUCTION

   

   

           6.  The Eigenvector Following (EF) routine, as described by  Baker,

               has  been  added.   This  normally, but not always, runs faster

               than the BFGS.  For this reason, the EF is the  preferred  (but

               not the default) geometry optimization technique.  In addition,

               EF can locate and refine transition states  (new  keyword  TS).

               This  copy  of  EF is a slightly modified form of the procedure

               recommended by Baker, Jensen, Rzepa and Stebbings.

   

   

   

   

   

   

      1.5  CRITERIA, LAYOUT, AND HOUSEKEEPING CHANGES

   

   

           1.  The LOG file will now be created in the  directory  from  which

               the  job is run.  This seems more sensible than having it go to

               the root directory.  If you want the LOG file to go to the root

               directory, modify MOPAC.COM as indicated in MOPAC.COM.

   

           2.  Some information on the job will be  output  to  the  log  file

               unless  'NOLOG' is specified.  This will consist of the keyword

               lines, the "cycles", and a copy of the archive file:   This  is

               useful  for two reasons:  (a) monitoring a running job, and (b)

               In case of a machine crash, which sometimes causes the OUT  and

               ARC files to be lost, the LOG file will normally survive.

   

           3.  The whole data-set is read in at the very start of a  run,  and

               put  into  a  scratch  file.   This  frees up the data-set in a

               transparent manner.

   

           4.  A normal MOPAC Z-matrix will no longer need  the  extra  zero's

               for  atoms  2  or  3,  even  if the connectivity is explicitely

               given.  Thus, the geometry of formaldehyde could be written as:

   

                  C                                        C

                  O  1.2 1                    instead of   O  1.2 1

                  H  1.1 1 120 1       1 2                 H  1.1 1 120 1   0 0 1 2

                  H  1.1 1 120 1 180 0 1 2 3               H  1.1 1 120 1 180 0 1 2 3

   

   

           5.  Element Specification:  In addition  to  the  chemical  symbol,

               users  can now add a brief (6 character) description of an atom

               by enclosing the description within brackets, e.g.  Br(Bridge),

               C(Me),  P(V),  H(on C23).  Some care should be exercised if the

               output is to be read in to another program, as the layout  will

               begin  to  change  when  any  discription  involves more than 3

               characters.

                                    INTRODUCTION

   

   

                    Dummy atoms can now be specified by the symbol 'X' or 'x',

               in  addition  to the current symbols 'XX', 'Xx', etc, and '99'.

               This change has been made to accommodate GAUSSIAN Z-matrices.

   

           6.  Version 6.0 will now allow multiple data-sets to be run as part

               of  one job.  The program is designed to consider each data-set

               as a wholly new calculation.  Thus, the first calculation might

               be  an  AM1  FORCE  calculation,  and the second a PM3 geometry

               optimization.  Limitations:  Except for the  first  system,  no

               system  must  cause  the  data-set  to be rewound.  Examples of

               data-sets which would cause a rewind are:

   

               1.  C.I.  calculations where the keyword MICROS is used.

   

               2.  Gaussian Z-matrices when the keyword AIGIN is NOT used.

   

               3.  When ab-initio gradients are read in, using keyword AIDER.

   

               4.  If ECHO is used.

   

   

           7.  In addition to internal and cartesian coordinates,  MOPAC  will

               now  allow  GAUSSIAN geometry files to be read in.  Most of the

               time, the file will be recognized automatically, but  for  very

               small  files  (two atom systems), the user will need to specify

               AIGIN.  If GAUSSIAN input is used, only one molecule can be run

               at  a  time,  unless  AIGIN  is  specified.   (MOPAC now allows

               several molecules to be run one after the other)

   

           8.  Energy gradients can be read in.  These  can  be  used  in  the

               calculation of ab initio stationary points.  See "Background".

   

           9.  The SCF criterion has been re-defined.  The new  SCF  criterion

               is  defined  as  follows:  "An SCF is assumed to exist when the

               energy change, in kcal/mol, drops below  SCFCRT  on  successive

               iterations".   There  are  other minor qualifications regarding

               the density matrix, but an SCF is defined mainly  in  terms  of

               energy fluctuation.  The other qualifications impose additional

               criteria on the SCF, and do not relax it.

   

          10.  Up to three lines are now  allowed  for  keywords.   Three  new

               keywords are used to define the keyword lines.  These are:

   

               1.  +:  A ' +' sign means  'read  another  line  of  keywords'.

                   Note  the  space  before  the  '+'  sign.   Since  '+' is a

                   keyword, it must be preceeded by a space.  A ' +' on line 1

                   would  mean  that  a second line of keywords should be read

                   in.  If that second line containes a  ' +',  then  a  third

                   line  of keywords will be read in.  Regardless of whether a

                   second or a third line of keywords is read in, the next two

                   lines will be description lines.

                       NOTE: There are two lines of description.]

   

               2.  &:  An ' &' means 'turn the next line  into  keywords'.   A

                   ' &'  on  line  1 would mean that a second line of keywords

                   should be read in.  If that second line containes  a  ' &',

                   then  a  third  line  of  keywords will be read in.  If the

                   first line has a ' &' then the first  description  line  is

                   omitted,   if  the  second  line  has  a  ' &',  then  both

                   description lines are omitted.

   

               3.  SETUP:  If, on  the  keyword  line,  the  word  'SETUP'  is

                   specified,  then  one or two lines of keywords will be read

                   from a file with the logical name SETUP.   The  file  SETUP

                   must  exist,  and  must  contain at least one line.  If the

                   second line of the data-set is defined by the first line as

                                                        _
                   a  keyword  line  (by  a  +  or  an  ), and the second line

                   contains the word SETUP, then one line of keywords will  be

                   read from a file with the logical name SETUP.  SETUP can be

                   followed, optionally, by the logical name, or the  name  of

                   the   file,   which   holds   the   SETUP  keywords,  e.g.,

                   SETUP=mydata.keys, SETUP=fred,  in  which  case  the  SETUP

                   keywords  are in the file mydata.keys, or the file with the

                   logical name fred.

   

   

                    The following table illustrates the allowed combinations

          Line 1      Line 2     Line 3  Line 4   Line 5  Setup used

          Keys &      Keys SETUP Text   Z-matrix Z-matrix 1 line used

   

                No other combinations are allowed.

   

                The proposed use of the SETUP option is to allow a  frequently

           used  set  of  keywords  to  be  defined  by a single keyword.  For

           example, if the default criteria  are  not  suitable,  SETUP  might

           contain

            " SCFCRT=1.D-8  SHIFT=30 ITRY=600 GNORM=0.02 ANALYT "

            "                                                   "

           The order of usage of a keyword is Line 1 > Line 2 > Line 3.   Line

      11.  Because of the steadily increasing number of keywords, a change has

           been  made  which  will allow a large number of keywords to be used

           without having a very large WRTKEY subroutine.  (WRTKEY checks  the

           validity  of  keywords,  and  prints  all  keywords used.) Now, all

           keywords which print details of subroutines will not be  explicitly

           recognized.    Instead,   if  DEBUG  is  specified,  all  otherwise

           unrecognized keywords will be assumed to be  valid  keywords.   The

           main  effect  is  that keywords such as FLEPO, LINMIN, MOLDAT, etc.

           are now not valid keywords, but can be used if the keyword DEBUG is

           also specified.

   

      12.  To save space, DRC and IRC outputs will, by default, only print the

           line with the percent sign.  Other output can be obtained by use of

           the keyword LARGE, according to the following rules:

   

              Keyword             Effect

              LARGE          Print all internal and cartesian coordinates 

                             and cartesian velocities.

              LARGE=1        Print all internal coordinates.

              LARGE=-1       Print all internal and cartesian coordinates 

                             and cartesian velocities.

              LARGE=n        Print every n'th set of internal coordinates.

              LARGE=-n       Print every n'th set of internal and cartesian 

                             coordinates and cartesian velocities.

   

                If LARGE=1 is used, the output will be the  same  as  that  of

           Version 5.0, when LARGE was not used.  If LARGE is used, the output

           will be the same as that of Version 5.0, when LARGE was  used.   To

           save disk space, do not use LARGE.

   

      13.  In order to allow  MOPAC  to  be  run  on  machines  which  do  not

           automatically  SAVE variables, many (but not all) variables are now

           SAVED.

   

      14.  A second copy of the ARCHIVE file is now automatically  written  to

           the LOG file.  This can be suppressed by specifying "NOLOG".

      1.6  IMPROVED OR NEW FUNCTIONALITIES

   

   

           1.  A completely new  functionality,  the  ElectroStatic  Potential

               calculation  of  Besler,  Merz,  and  Kollman,  has been added.

               Because of its size, it is not part of the default  MOPAC,  but

               can  be  added  at  any  time.  Instructions on this are in the

               Manual.

   

           2.  The C.I.  keyword has been extended  to  allow  the  number  of

               doubly-filled  levels  to be specified.  The extended format is

               C.I.=(N,M), where N is the number  of  M.O.s  involved  in  the

               C.I., and M is the number of filled levels.

           3.  Phonon  and  electronic  band  structure   calculation.    Both

               calculations can be run on a polymer.  The same keyword is used

               to specify both.  Which calculation is actually run depends  on

               other   keywords,   e.g.,  if  FORCE  is  specified,  a  phonon

               calculation will be run, otherwise a band-structure calculation

               will be run.

   

           4.  The hyperpolarizability calculation has been made more precise.

      1.7  EXTENSION TO NEW ELEMENTS.

   

   

           1.  AM1:  New elements added:  Aluminum, Phosphorus and Sulfur.

   

                    Editorial comment:

   

                    Extra  care  should  be  taken  when  using  aluminum   or

               phosphorus.  Both elements have sharp energy barriers, aluminum

               at 2.05 Angstroms and phosphorus at 3.0 Angstroms.   These  can

               severely  complicate  results.   Thus  Al2F6  has  three stable

               bridged configurations, and P4O6 and P4O10 are highly distorted

               relative   to  the  correct  Td  geometry,  the  P-P  distances

               differing by 0.4 Angstroms.

   

           2.  MNDO:  None.

   

           3.  PM3:  Beryllium, Magnesium, Zinc, Gallium, Germanium,  Arsenic,

               Selenium,  Cadmium,  Indium, Tin, Antimony, Tellurium, Mercury,

               Thallium, Lead, and Bismuth.

   

                    Editorial comment:

   

                    Extra  care  should  be  taken  with  cadmium  and   other

               elements.   The  paucity  of  reference data resulted in a high

               accuracy, poorly predictive method.

           An ' &' means 'turn the next line into keywords'.  A ' &' on line 1

      would  mean  that  a second line of keywords should be read in.  If that

      second line contained a ' &', then a third line  of  keywords  would  be

      read  in.   If the first line has a ' &' then the first description line

      is omitted, if the second line has a ' &', then both  description  lines

      are omitted.

           A ' +' sign means 'read another line of keywords'.  Note the  space

      before  the '+' sign.  Since '+' is a keyword, it must be preceeded by a

      space.  A ' +' on line 1 would mean  that  a  second  line  of  keywords

      should  be  read in.  If that second line containes a ' +', then a third

      line of keywords will be read in.  Regardless of whether a second  or  a

      third  line  of  keywords  is  read  in,  the  next  two  lines would be

      description lines.

                                      1SCF (C)

   

           When users want to examine the results of a single SCF  calculation

      of  a  geometry,  1SCF  should be used.  1SCF can be used in conjunction

      with RESTART, in which case a single SCF calculation will be  done,  and

      the results printed.

   

           When 1SCF is used on its own (that is, RESTART is  not  also  used)

      then derivatives will only be calculated if GRAD is also specified.

   

           1SCF is helpful in a learning situation.  MOPAC  normally  performs

      many  SCF  calculations,  and in order to minimize output when following

      the working of the SCF calculation, 1SCF is very useful.

   

   

                                     AIDER (C)

   

           AIDER allows MOPAC to optimize an ab-initio geometry.  To  use  it,

      calculate  the  ab-initio gradients using, e.g., Gaussian.  Supply MOPAC

      with these gradients, after converting them into kcal/mol.  The geometry

      resulting  from  a  MOPAC  run will be nearer to the optimized ab-initio

      geometry than if the geometry optimizer in Gaussian had been used.

                                     AIGIN (C)

   

           If the geometry (Z-matrix) is specified using the Gaussian-8X, then

      normally  this will be read in without difficulty.  In the event that it

      is mistaken for a normal  MOPAC-type  Z-matrix,  the  keyword  AIGIN  is

      provided.  As of the time of writing, no examples of data requiring this

      keyword have been made.  AIGIN  is  therefore  a  hedge  against  as-yet

      unknown  problems  with Z-matrices.  AIGIN will force the data-set to be

      read in assuming Gaussian format.  This is necessary if  more  than  one

      system is being studied in one run.

   

   

                                     AIGOUT (O)

   

           The ARCHIVE file contains a data-set  suitable  for  submission  to

      MOPAC.   If,  in  addition  to  this data-set, the Z-matrix for Gaussian

      input is wanted, then AIGOUT (ab  initio  geometry  output),  should  be

      used.

   

           The Z-matrix is in full Gaussian form.   Symmetry,  where  present,

      will be correctly defined.  Names of symbolics will be those used if the

      original geometry was in Gaussian format, otherwise 'logical' names will

      be used.  Logical names are of form <t><a><b>[<c>][<d>] where <t> is 'r'

      for bond length, 'a' for angle, or 'd' for dihedral,  <a>  is  the  atom

      number, <b> is the atom to which <a> is related, <c>, if present, is the

      atom number to which <a> makes an angle, and <d>,  if  present,  is  the

      atom number to which <a> makes a dihedral.

   

           If 1SCF is specified, extra care should be taken to ensure that the

      desired  format is generated.  If the 1SCF is used in conjunction with a

      RESTART, then the variables defined will be those of the  original  job.

      Otherwise,  by  default,  when  1SCF  is  specified,  gradients  are not

      calculated.  This means  that  all  variables  become  fixed,  i.e.,  no

      symbolics are used.  See also 1SCF and RESTART.

   

   

                                       DIPOLE

   

           Used in the ESP calculation, DIPOLE will constrain  the  calculated

      charges  to  reproduce the cartesian dipole moment components calculated

      from the density matrix and nuclear charges.

                                        DIPX

      Similar to DIPOLE, except the fit will be for the X-component only.

   

   

                                        DIPY

      Similar to DIPOLE, except the fit will be for the Y-component only.

   

   

                                        DIPZ

      Similar to DIPOLE, except the fit will be for the Z-component only.

   

   

                                     DMAX=n.nn

   

           In the EF routine, the  maximum  step-size  is  0.2  (Angstroms  or

      radians),  by  default.   This  can  be changed by specifying DMAX=n.nn.

      Increasing DMAX can lead to faster convergence but  can  also  make  the

      optimization  go  bad  very fast.  Furthermore, the Hessian updating may

      deteriorate when using large stepsizes.  Reducing the stepsize  to  0.10

      or 0.05 is recommended when encountering convergence problems.

   

   

   

           EF (C)

   

           The Eigenvector Following routine is an alternative  to  the  BFGS,

      and  appears  to  be  much  faster.  To invoke the eigenvector following

      routine, specify EF.  EF is particularly good in the end-game, when  the

      gradient is small.  See also HESS, DMAX, EIGINV.

   

   

                                     EIGINV (W)

   

           Not recommended for normal use.  Used with  the  EF  routine.   See

      source code for more details.

   

   

                                        ESP

      This is  the  ElectroStatic  Potential  calculation  of  K. M. Merz  and

      B. H. Besler.    ESP   calculates   the   expectation   values   of  the

      electrostatic potential of a  molecule  on  a  uniform  distribution  of

      points.   The  resultant  ESP  surface  is  then fitted to atom centered

      charges that best reproduce the distribution, in a least squares sense.

      ESPRST restarts a stopped ESP calculation.  Do not use with RESTART.

   

   

                                     IUPD=n (W)

   

           IUPD is used only in the EF routine.  IUPD should  very  rarely  be

      touched.   IUPD=1  can  be  used  in minimum searches if the the message

      "HEREDITARY  POSITIVE  DEFINITENESS  ENDANGERED.   UPDATE  SKIPPED  THIS

      CYCLE"  occurs every cycle for 10-20 iterations.  Never use IUPD=2 for a

      TS search!  For more information, read the comments in subroutine EF.

   

   

                                     HESS=n (W)

   

           When  the  Eigenvector  Following  routine  is  used  for  geometry

      optimization,  it  frequently works faster if the Hessian is constructed

      first.  If HESS=1 is specified, the Hessian matrix will  be  constructed

      before  the  geometry  is  optimized.   There  are  other,  less common,

      options, e.g.  HESS=2.  See comments in subroutine EF for details.

   

   

                                   K=(n.nn,n) (C)

   

           Used  in  band-structure  calculations,  K=(n.nn,n)  specifies  the

      step-size  in  the  Brillouin  zone,  and  the  number  of  atoms in the

      monomeric  unit.   Two  band-structure   calculations   are   supported:

      electronic  and phonon.  Both require a polymer to be used.  If FORCE is

      used, a  phonon  spectrum  is  assumed,  otherwise  an  electronic  band

      structure  is  assumed.   For  both calculations, a density of states is

      also done.  The band structure calculation is  very  fast,  so  a  small

      step-size will not use much time.

   

           The output is designed to be fed into a graphics  package,  and  is

      not   'elegant'.    For   polyethylene,  a  suitable  keyword  would  be

      K=(0.01,6).

   

   

                                      MODE (C)

   

           MODE is used in the EF routine.  Normally  the  default  MODE=1  is

      used  to locate a transition state, but if this is incorrect, explicitly

      define the vector to be followed by MODE=n.  (MODE is not a  recommended

      keyword).   If  you  use  the  FORCE  option when deciding which mode to

      follow, set all isotopic masses to 1.0.  The normal modes from FORCE are

      normally mass-weighted; this can mislead.  Alternatively, use LARGE with

      FORCE:  this gives the force constants and vectors in  addition  to  the

      mass-weighted  normal  modes.  Only the mass-weighted modes can be drawn

      with DRAW.

           Useful for checking the MECI calculation and  for  teaching.   MS=n

      overrides the normal choice of magnetic component of spin.  Normally, if

      a triplet is requested, a MS of  1  will  be  used;  this  excludes  all

      singlets.  If MS=0 is also given, then singlets will also be calculated.

      The use of MS should not affect the values of the results at all.

   

   

                                     NOANCI (W)

   

           RHF open-shell derivatives are normally calculated using  Liotard's

      analytical  C.I.   method.   If  this  method is NOT to ne used, specify

      NOANCI (NO ANalytical Configuration Interaction derivatives).

   

   

                                     NODIIS (W)

   

           In the event that the G-DIIS option is not wanted,  NODIIS  can  be

      used.   The  G-DIIS  normally accelerates the geometry optimization, but

      there is no guarantee that it will do so.   If  the  heat  of  formation

      rises unexpectedly (i.e.  rises during a geometry optimization while the

      GNORM is larger than about 0.3), then try NODIIS.

   

   

                                     NOLOG (O)

   

           Normally a copy of the archive file will be  directed  to  the  LOG

      file,  along  with a synopsis of the job.  If this is not wanted, it can

      be suppressed completely by NOLOG.

                                    NOTHIEL (W)

   

           In a normal geometry optimization using the BFGS  routine,  Thiel's

      FSTMIN  technique  is used.  If normal line-searches are wanted, specify

      NOTHIEL.

      layers for the Connolly surface.

   

   

                                     OLDGEO (C)

   

           If multiple geometries are to be run, and the final  geometry  from

      one  calculation  is  to  be  used to start the next calculation, OLDGEO

      should be specified.  Example:  If a MNDO, AM1, and PM3 calculation were

      to be done on one system, for which only a rough geometry was available,

      then after the MNDO calculation, the AM1 calculation could be done using

      the  optimized  MNDO  geometry  as  the starting geometry, by specifying

      OLDGEO.

      is  part  of the EF routine, and means "Use whatever Lamdas are produced

      even if they would normally be 'unacceptable'."

      specified by POINT=n.  Used only with STEP in a path calculation.

   

   

                                    POINT1=n (C)

                                      RECALC=n

   

           RECALC=n  calculates  the  Hessian  every  n  steps   in   the   EF

      optimization.   For small n this is costly but is also very effective in

      terms of  convergence.   RECALC=10  and  DMAX=0.10  can  be  useful  for

      difficult  cases.   In  extreme cases RECALC=1 and DMAX=0.05 will always

      find a stationary point, if it exists.

   

   

                                       SCALE

   

           SCALE=n.n specifies the scaling factor for Van der Waals' radii for

      the initial layer of the Connolly surface in the ESP calculation.

   

   

                                  SCFCRT=n.nn (W)

   

           The default SCF criterion is to be  replaced  by  that  defined  by

      SCFCRT=.

   

           The SCF criterion is the  change  in  energy  in  kcal/mol  on  two

      successive  iterations.   Other minor criteria may make the requirements

      for an SCF slightly more stringent.  The SCF  criterion  can  be  varied

      from  about  0.001  to  1.D-25,  although numbers in the range 0.0001 to

      1.D-9 will suffice for most applications.

      layers of the surface in the Connolly surface.  (default:  0.20)

                                      STEP (C)

   

           In a reaction path, if the path step is constant, STEP can be  used

      instead  of  explicitly  specifying  each point.  The number of steps is

      given by POINT.  If the reaction coordinate is an interatomic  distance,

      only positive STEPs are allowed.

   

   

                                       SYMAVG

      3.1  AIDER

   

           AIDER will allow gradients to be defined for a system.  MOPAC  will

      calculate  gradients,  as  usual, and then use the supplied gradients to

      form an error function.  The error function  is  (supplied  gradients  -

      initial  calculated  gradients).   This  is  then  added to the computed

      gradients, so that for the initial  SCF,  the  apparent  gradients  will

      equal the supplied gradients.

   

           A typical data-set using AIDER would look like this:

           Each  supplied  gradient  goes  with  the  corresponding   internal

      coordinate.   In  the  example  given,  the  gradients came from a 3-21G

      calculation on the geometry shown.  Symmetry will be taken into  account

      automatically.   Gaussian  prints  out  gradients in atomic units; these

      need to be converted into kcal/mol/Angstrom or kcal/mol/radian for MOPAC

      to use.  The resulting geometry from the MOPAC run will be nearer to the

      optimized 3-21G geometry than  if  the  normal  geometry  optimizers  in

      Gaussian had been used.

   

   

   

      3.2  GAUSSIAN Z-MATRICES

   

           With certain limitations, geometries can now  be  specified  within

      MOPAC using the Gaussian Z-matrix format.

                      Exceptions to the full Gaussian standard

   

           1.  The option of defining an atom's position by one  distance  and

               two  angles  is  not  allowed.  In other words, the N4 variable

               described in the Gaussian manual must either  be  zero  or  not

               specified.   MOPAC requires the geometry of atoms to be defined

               in terms  of,  at  most,  one  distance,  one  angle,  and  one

               dihedral.

   

           2.  Gaussian cartesian coordinates are not supported.

   

           3.  Chemical symbols must not be followed by an integer identifying

               the atom.  Numbers after a symbol are used by MOPAC to indicate

               isotopic mass.  If labels are desired, they should be  enclosed

               in parentheses, thus "Cl(on C5)34.96885"

   

           4.  The connectivity (N1, N2, N3) must be integers.  Labels are not

               allowed.

   

   

   

                       Specification of Gaussian Z-matrices.

   

           The information contained in the Gaussian Z-matrix is identical  to

      that in a MOPAC Z-matrix.  The order of presentation is different.  Atom

      N, (real or dummy) is specified in the format:

        Element   N1   Length  N2  Alpha   N3  Beta

   

           Where Element is the same as for the MOPAC Z-matrix.  N1,  N2,  and

      N3  are the connectivity, the same as the MOPAC Z-matrix NA, NB, and NC:

      bond lengths are between N and N1, angles are between N, N1 and N2,  and

      dihedrals  are  between  N, N1, N2, and N3.  The same rules apply to N1,

      N2, and N3 as to NA, NB, and NC.

   

           Length, Alpha and  Beta  are  the  bond  lengths,  the  angle,  and

      dihedral.   They can be real, e.g.  1.45, 109.4, 180.0, or 'logical'.  A

      logical is an alphanumeric string of up  to  8  characters,  e.g.   R51,

      A512,  D5213, CH, CHO, CHOC, etc.  Two or more logicals can be the same.

      Dihedral logicals can optionally be preceeded by a minus sign, in  which

      case  the  value  of  the  dihedral  is the negative of the value of the

      logical.  This is the equivalent of the normal MOPAC SYMMETRY operations

      1, 2, 3, and 14.

   

           If an internal coordinate is real, it will not be optimized.   This

      is  the  equivalent  of the MOPAC optimization flag "0".  If an internal

      coordinate is logical, it can be optimized.

   

           The Z-matrix is terminated by a blank line, after which  comes  the

      starting values of the logicals, one per line.  If there is a blank line

      in this set, then all logicals  after  the  blank  line  are  considered

      fixed;  that  is,  they will not be optimized.  The set before the blank

      line will be optimized.

   

           If a Gaussian Z-matrix is supplied, the keyword SYMMETRY should NOT

      be  specified,  even if symmetry is defined by the Z-matrix.  At the end

      of the job, if the MOPAC Z-matrix format is wanted, you will need to add

      SYMMETRY to the keyword line, if the Gaussian Z-matrix implied symmetry.
