   During this time several co-workers provided  invaluable  assistance.
   Some  contributed  code,  some  ideas,  and some identified bugs.  Of
   those who helped, I would like to recognise the following people  for
   their assistance during the writing of MOPAC.
 
               For his patience and considerable technical expertise,  I
          am  indebted  to  Dr.  Santiago Olivella.  Dr.  Olivella wrote
          ENPART, and read  the  entire  program,  identifying  a  large
          number of coding and theoretical errors.
 
               Prof.  Peter Pulay developed the theory used in DIAG, and
          was  the  driving  force  behind  its  development.   He  also
          developed the theory behind, and helped in the writing of, the
          sophisticated SCF converger PULAY.
 
               Major Donn Storch, at the Air  Force  Academy,  has  been
          involved  during  the  entire  development  of MOPAC, taking a
          professional interest  in  its  design  and  structure.   Many
          improvements,  normally  unseen in routine use, are due to his
          practical suggestions.
 
               No large program is bug-free,  and  discovering  bugs  is
          very    demanding.    This   arduous   task   was   undertaken
          enthusiastically by Mr.  James Friedheim, who identified  what
          felt like hundreds of bugs.
 
               For advice and encouragement I thank  Dr.   Eamon  Healy.
          With his expert knowledge of quantum mechanics, Dr.  Healy was
          able to check the soundness of each new option provided.
 
               For  describing   the   FRAME   device   for   separating
          translations  and rotations in normal coordinate analysis, and
          for providing code for the Camp-King converger,  I  thank  Dr.
          John  McKelvey,  of  Eastman-Kodak.   He also made available a
          program to format the FORTRAN code to facilitate  reading  and
          debugging.
 
               For her unflagging patience in checking  the  manual  for
          clarity  of  expression,  and  for  drawing  to  my  attention
          innumerable spelling and grammatical errors, I thank my  wife,
          Anna.
 
        Finally,  I  wish  to  thank  Prof.   Michael  J.S.   Dewar  for
   providing  the  facilities  and funds during the initial development,
   the staff of the Seiler Research Laboratory for  their  support,  and
   the  National  Research  Council for the award of an Associateship to
   continue the development of MOPAC.

                 PREFACE TO THIRD VERSION, VERSION 3.00
 
 
 
        MOPAC is the core program  of  a  series  of  programs  for  the
   theoretical  study  of chemical phenomena.  This version is the third
   in an on-going development, and efforts are being  made  to  continue
   its  further  evolution.   In  order to make the use of MOPAC easier,
   four other programs have also  been  written.   Users  of  MOPAC  are
   recommended  to  use  all  four  programs.   Efforts  will be made to
   continue the development of these programs.
 
 
                          Recommended Programs
 
        DRAW
        ____
 
        DRAW, written by  Maj.   Donn  Storch,  is  a  powerful  editing
   program  specifically  written  to  interface  with MOPAC.  Among the
   various facilities it offers are:
 
   1.  The on-line editing and analysis of a data  file,  starting  from
       scratch or from an existing data file, an archive file, or from a
       results file.
 
   2.  The option of continuous graphical representation of  the  system
       being   studied.    Several  types  of  terminal  are  supported,
       including DIGITAL, HEATHKIT, TEKTRONIX, and TERAK terminals.
 
   3.  The drawing of electron density contour maps generated by DENSITY
       on graphical devices.
 
   4.  The drawing of solid-state band structures generated by MOSOL.
 
   5.  The sketching of molecular  vibrations,  generated  by  a  normal
       coordinate analysis.
 
 
        DENSITY
        _______
 
        DENSITY,  written  by  Dr.   James  J.   P.   Stewart,   is   an
   electron-density  plotting  program.   It accepts data-files directly
   from  MOPAC,  and  is  intended  to  be  used   for   the   graphical
   representation of electron density distribution, individual M.O.s and
   difference maps.

        MOHELP
        ______
 
        MOHELP is an on-line help facility, written by Maj.  Donn Storch
   and  Dr.  James J.  P.  Stewart, to allow non-VAX users access to the
   VAX HELP libraries for MOPAC, DRAW and DENSITY.
 
        MOSOL
        _____
 
        MOSOL is a full solid-state MNDO program written by  Dr.   James
   J.   P.  Stewart.  In comparison with MOPAC, MOSOL is extremely slow.
   As a result, while geometry optimization, force constants, and  other
   functions  can  be  carried out by MOSOL, these slow calculations are
   best done using the solid-state facility within MOPAC.  MOSOL  should
   only  be used for generating band-structures and densities of states,
   a task that MOPAC cannot perform.
 
 
            IMPORTANT CHANGES FROM EARLIER VERSIONS OF MOPAC
            _________ _______ ____ _______ ________ __ _____
 
 
        Two important modifications have been made, that users  must  be
   aware of.  These are
 
        (1) In FORCE calculations, atomic weights, not isotopic  masses,
   are   used.    This  change  is  justified  by  the  fact  that  most
   experimental  measurements  are  made  using  the  natural  abundance
   isotopes.  The option of using specific isotopes is provided.
 
        (2) In the FORCE calculation, if the  geometry  is  not  already
   optimized, then, by default, the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell optimization
   will  be  used  to  optimize  it,  instead  of   Bartell's   gradient
   minimization.  The option of using Bartell's method is provided.

                              INTRODUCTION
 
 
 
        MOPAC is  a  general-purpose  semi-empirical  molecular  orbital
   package  for  the  study  of  chemical reactions.  The semi-empirical
   Hamiltonians MNDO, MINDO/3, and AM1 are implemented, and calculations
   of    vibrational   spectra,   thermodynamic   quantities,   isotopic
   substitution effects and force  constants  for  molecules,  radicals,
   ions,  and  polymers  are  combined  in  a  fully integrated package.
   Within the  electronic  part  of  the  calculation  eigenvectors  and
   localized   orbitals,   chemical  bond  indices,  charges,  molecular
   orbitals etc.  are calculable.  For  studying  chemical  reactions  a
   transition-state location routine and two transition state optimizing
   routines are available.  For potential users to get the most  out  of
   the  program they must understand how the program works, how to enter
   data, how to interpret the results, and what to  do  when  things  go
   wrong.
 
        While MOPAC calls upon  many  concepts  in  quantum  theory  and
   thermodynamics  and  uses  some fairly advanced mathematics, the user
   who is not familiar with these specialized  topics  should  not  feel
   excluded  from  using it.  On the contrary, MOPAC is written with the
   non-theoretician in mind.  To this end the data are kept as simple as
   possible;   this  means  that  users  can give their attention to the
   chemistry involved, and  not  concern  themselves  with  quantum  and
   thermodynamic exotica.
 
 
 
        NOTES (1) This is the "third edition".  MOPAC  has  undergone  a
   considerable  expansion  since  the  second version, and users of the
   first or second editions are recommended  to  familiarize  themselves
   with  the  changes which are described in this manual.  If any errors
   are found, or if MOPAC does not perform as described, please  contact
   Dr.  James J.  P.  Stewart, FJSRL, USAFA, Colorado Springs, CO 80840.
 
        (2) MOPAC runs sucessfully on normal  CDC,  IBM,  Data  General,
   Gould,  and  DIGITAL  computers, and also on the CDC 205 and CRAY-XMP
   "supercomputers".

   1.2  LAYOUT OF DATA
 
        This section is aimed at the  complete  novice  --  someone  who
   knows nothing at all about the structure of a MOPAC data-file.
 
        First  of  all,  there  are  at  most  four  possible  types  of
   data-files for MOPAC, but the simplest data-file is the most commonly
   used.  Rather than define it, an example will be shown.
 
 
 
 
 
   1.2.1  Example Of Data For Ethylene
 
     Line   1 :     UHF PULAY MINDO3 VECTORS DENSITY LOCAL T=300
     Line   2 :      EXAMPLE OF DATA FOR MOPAC
     Line   3 :        MINDO/3 UHF CLOSED-SHELL D2D ETHYLENE
     Line   4a:    C
     Line   4b:    C    1.400118  1
     Line   4c:    H    1.098326  1  123.572063  1
     Line   4d:    H    1.098326  1  123.572063  1  180.000000  0   2  1  3
     Line   4e:    H    1.098326  1  123.572063  1   90.000000  0   1  2  3
     Line   4f:    H    1.098326  1  123.572063  1  270.000000  0   1  2  3
     Line   5 :
 
        As can be seen, the first three lines are  textual.   The  first
   line  consists  of key-words (here seven key-words are shown).  These
   control the calculation.  The next two lines are comments or  titles.
   The  user  might  want  to put the name of the molecule and why it is
   being run on these two lines.
 
        These three lines are obligatory.  If  no  name  or  comment  is
   wanted,  leave  blank  lines.  If no key-words are specified, leave a
   blank line.  A common error is  to  have  a  blank  line  before  the
   key-word line:  this error is quite tricky to find, so be careful not
   to have four lines before the start of the geometric data.   Whatever
   is decided, the three lines are obligatory.
 
        The next set of lines define the geometry.  In the example,  the
   numbers  are  all  neatly  lined up;  this is not necessary, but does
   make it easier when looking for errors in the data.  The geometry  is
   defined  in  lines 4a to 4f;  line 5 terminates both the geometry and
   the data-file.  Any additional data, for example symmetry data, would
   follow line 5.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                  1-3
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        Summarizing, then, the structure for a MOPAC data-file is:
 
 
    Line  1:   Key-Words. (See chapter on definitions of key-words)
    Line  2:   Title of the calculation,  e.g. the name of the molecule or ion.
    Line  3:   Other information describing the calculation.
    Line  4:   Internal or cartesian coordinates (See chapter on
               specification of geometry)
    Line  5:   Blank line to shut down geometry definition.
 
        Other layouts for data-files involve  additions  to  the  simple
   layout.   These  additions  occur  at the end of the data-file, after
   line 5.  The three most common additions are:
 
        (a) Symmetry data:  This follows  the  geometric  data,  and  is
   ended by a blank line.
 
        (b) Reaction path:  After all geometry  and  symmetry  data  (if
   any) are read in, points on the reaction coordinate are defined.
 
        (c) Saddle data:  A complete  second  geometry  is  input.   The
   second  geometry  follows  the  first  geometry and symmetry data (if
   present)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                  1-4

        Polytetrahydrofuran has a repeat unit  of  (C4  H8  O)2;   i.e.,
   twice  the  monomer  unit.   This  is necessary in order to allow the
   lattice to repeat after a translation through  12.3  Angstroms.   See
   the section on Solid State Capability for further details.
 
        Note the two dummy atoms on lines 4k and 4l.  These are  useful,
   but  not essential, for defining the geometry.  The atoms on lines 4y
   to 4B use these dummy atoms, as does the translation vector  on  line
   4C.
 
        The  translation  vector  has  only  the   length   marked   for
   optimization.    The  reason  for  this  is  also  explained  in  the
   Background chapter.

   2.1  SPECIFICATION OF KEY WORDS
 
        All control data are entered in the  form  of  key-words,  which
   form  the  first  line  of a data-file.  The order in which key-words
   appear is not important although they must be separated by  a  space.
   Some  key-words  can  be  abbreviated  (for  example 1ELECTRON can be
   entered as 1ELECT) but in general the  full  key-word  is  preferred,
   primarily  in  order  to  more  clearly document the calculation, and
   secondarily to obviate the possibility that an  abbreviated  key-word
   might not be recognized.  If there is insufficient space in the first
   line for all the key-words needed,  then  consider  abbreviating  the
   longer  words.   One type of key-word, those ending in an equal sign,
   such as, BAR=0.05, may not be abbreviated, and the full word needs to
   be supplied.
 
        If two key-words which are incompatible, like UHF and C.I.,  are
   supplied,  or  a  key-word  which  is  incompatible  with the species
   supplied, for instance TRIPLET  and  a  methyl  radical,  then  error
   trapping  will  normally  occur,  and an error message printed.  This
   usually takes an insignificant time, so data are easily  checked  for
   obvious errors.

   2.3  DEFINITIONS OF KEY-WORDS
 
 
 
                               1ELECTRON
 
        The final one-electron matrix is printed out.   This  matrix  is
   composed of atomic orbitals;  the element between orbitals i and j on
   different atoms is given by
                 H(i,j) = 0.5 x (beta(i) +beta(j)) x overlap(i,j)
 
        The matrix elements between orbitals i and j on  the  same  atom
   are  calculated from the electron-nuclear attraction energy, and also
   from the U(i) value, if i=j.
 
        The one-electron matrix is unaffected by (a) the charge, and (b)
   the  electron  density.   It  is  only  a  function  of the geometry.
   Abbreviation:  1ELEC.
 
 
                                  0SCF
 
        The data can be read in and output, but no actual calculation is
   performed  by  using  this  key-word.   This  is  useful for checking
   purposes.
 
 
                                  1SCF
 
        When a single geometry is to be studied,  then  1SCF  should  be
   used.   All  the  key-words  relevant  to output can be used.  If the
   gradients are to be calculated, then GRADIENTS should  be  specified.
   They are not calculated by default.
 
        If the key-word RESTART is  also  present,  then  the  geometric
   parameters  which  were  being optimized will be used in the gradient
   calculation.
 
        1SCF  is  helpful  in  a  learning  situation.   MOPAC  normally
   performs  many SCF calculations, and in order to minimize output when
   following the working of the SCF calculation, 1SCF is very useful.
 
 
                                  AM1
 
        The new AM1 method is to be used.  By default MNDO is run.

                                  BAR=
 
        In  the  SADDLE  calculation  the  distance  between   the   two
   geometries is steadily reduced until the transition state is located.
   Sometimes, however, the user may want to alter the  maximum  rate  at
   which  the  distance  between  the  two geometries reduces.  BAR is a
   ratio, normally 0.15, or 15 percent.  This represents a maximum  rate
   of  reduction  of the bar of 15 percent per step.  Alternative values
   that might be considered are BAR=0.05  or  BAR=0.10,  although  other
   values may be used.
 
 
                                BIRADICAL
 
        NOTE:  BIRADICAL is  a  redundant  key-word,  and  represents  a
   particular  configuration interaction calculation.  Experienced users
   of MECI can duplicate the effect of the key-word BIRADICAL  by  using
   the MECI key-words OPEN(2,2) and SINGLET.
 
        For molecules which are believed to have biradicaloid  character
   the  option  exists to optimize the lowest singlet energy state which
   results from the mixing of three states.  These states are, in order,
   (1)  the (micro)state arising from a one electron excitation from the
   HOMO to the LUMO, which is combined  with  the  microstate  resulting
   from  the time-reversal operator acting on the parent microstate, the
   result being a full singlet state;   (2)  the  state  resulting  from
   de-excitation  from  the  formal LUMO to the HOMO;  and (3) the state
   resulting from the single electron in the formal HOMO  being  excited
   into the LUMO.

   A  configuration  interaction  calculation  is  involved   here.    A
   biradical  calculation  done  without C.I.  at the RHF level would be
   meaningless.  Either rotational invariance would be lost, as  in  the
   DU2dD  form  of  ethylene,  or  very artificial barriers to rotations
   would be found, such as in a  methane  molecule  "orbiting"  a  DU2dD
   ethylene.   In  both  cases  the  inclusion  of limited configuration
   interaction corrects the error.  BIRADICAL  should  not  be  used  if
   either  the  HOMO  or  LUMO  is  degenerate;   in this case, the full
   manifold of HOMO x LUMO should be included in the  C.I.,  using  MECI
   options.   The  user  should  be  aware  of this situation.  When the
                                  2-5
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   biradical calculation is performed correctly, the result is  normally
   a  net stabilization.  However, if the first singlet excited state is
   much higher in energy than the closed-shell ground  state,  BIRADICAL
   can lead to a destabilization.  Abbreviation:  BIRAD.
 
 
                                  BONDS
 
        The rotationally invariant bond order between all pairs of atoms
   is  printed.   In  this  context  a bond is defined as the sum of the
   squares of the density matrix elements connecting any two atoms.  For
   ethane,  ethylene,  and  acetylene  the carbon-carbon bond orders are
   roughly 1.00, 2.00, and 3.00 respectively.  The  diagonal  terms  are
   the  valencies  calculated from the atomic terms only and are defined
   as the sum of the bonds the atom makes with other atoms.  In UHF  and
   non-variationally optimized wavefunctions the calculated valency will
   be  incorrect,  the  degree  of  error  being  proportional  to   the
   non-duodempotency of the density matrix.  For an RHF wavefunction the
   square of the density matrix is equal to twice the density matrix.
 
 
                                  C.I.
 
        Normally configuration interaction is  invoked  if  any  of  the
   key-words   which  imply  a  C.I.   calculation  are  used,  such  as
   BIRADICAL, TRIPLET, QUARTET.  Note that ROOT= does not imply  a  C.I.
   calculation:   ROOT=  is  only used when a C.I.  calculation is done.
   However, as  these  implied  C.I.s  involve  the  minimum  number  of
   configurations  practical,  the user may want to define a larger than
   minimum C.I., in which case the key-word C.I.=n can  be  used.   When
   C.I.=n  is  specified,  the  n  M.O.s  which  "bracket" the occupied-
   virtual energy levels will be used.  Thus C.I.=2  will  include  both
   the  HOMO  and  the  LUMO,  while  C.I.=1  (implied  for odd-electron
   systems) will only include the HOMO  (This  will  do  nothing  for  a
   closed-shell system, and lead to Dewar's half-electron correction for
   odd-electron systems).  Users should be aware of the  rapid  increase
   in the size of the C.I.  with increasing numbers of M.O.s being used.
   Numbers of microstates implied by the use of the key-word  C.I.=n  on
   its own are as follows:
    Keyword        Even-electron systems           Odd-electron systems
                No. of electrons, configs       No. of electrons, configs

     C.I.=2       1      1          4            1     0             2
     C.I.=3       2      2          9            2     1             9
     C.I.=4       2      2         36            2     1            24

     C.I.=8   (Do not use unless other key-words also used, see below)
 
        If a change of spin is defined, then larger numbers of M.O.s can
   be  used  up  to  a maximum of 10.  The C.I.  matrix is of size 100 x
   100.  For  calculations  involving  up  to  100  configurations,  the
   spin-states are exact eigenstates of the spin operators.  For systems
                                  2-6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                               KEY-WORDS
 
 
   with more than 100 configurations, the 100 configurations  of  lowest
   energy  are  used.   See  also  MICROS  and  the  key-words  defining
   spin-states.
 
        Note that for any system,  use  of  C.I.=5  or  higher  normally
   implies  the  diagonalization  of a 100 by 100 matrix.  As a geometry
   optimization using a C.I.  requires the derivatives to be  calculated
   using  full  SCF calculations, geometry optimization with large C.I.s
   will require a considerable amount of time.

        When the system being studied is an ion, the charge, n,  on  the
   ion  can  be supplied by CHARGE=n.  For cations n can be 1 or 2 or 3,
   etc, for anions -1 or -2 or -3, etc.
                             EXAMPLES
        ION               KEYWORD              ION          KEYWORD
        NH4(+)           CHARGE=1             CH3COO(-)      CHARGE=-1

                                 CYCLES=
 
        In Bartel's method of gradient  norm  minimization,  NLLSQ,  the
   default  number of cycles (100) is replaced by the number n specified
   by CYCLES=n.
 
 
                                 DCART
 
        The cartesian derivatives which  are  calculated  in  DCART  for
   variationally  optimized systems are printed if the key-word DCART is
   present.  The derivatives are in units  of  kcals/Angstrom,  and  the
   coordinates are displacements in x, y, and z.
 
 
                                  DEBUG
 
        Certain key-words have specific output control meanings, such as
   FOCK,  VECTORS  and DENSITY.  If they are used, only the final arrays
   of the relevant type are printed.  If DEBUG  is  supplied,  then  all
   arrays  are  printed.   This  is useful in debugging ITER.  DEBUG can
   also increase the amount of output produced when a key-word is  used,
   e.g.  COMPFG.
 
 
                                  DENOUT
 
        The density matrix at the end of the calculation is to be output
   in  a  form  suitable for input in another job.  If an automatic dump
   due to the time being exceeded occurs during  the  current  run  then
   DENOUT is invoked automatically.  (see RESTART)

                                 DENSITY
 
        At the end of a job, when the results  are  being  printed,  the
   density matrix is also printed.  For RHF the normal density matrix is
   printed, for UHF the addition of the alpha and beta density  matrices
   is printed.
 
        If density is not requested, then the diagonal  of  the  density
 
   matrix, that is, the electron density on the atomic orbitals, will be
   printed.
 
 
                                  DEP
 
        For use only with EXTERNAL=.  When new parameters are published,
   they  can  be  entered at run-time by using EXTERNAL=, but as this is
   somewhat clumsy, a permanent change can be made by use of DEP.
 
        If DEP is invoked, a complete block  of  FORTRAN  code  will  be
   generated,  and  this  can  be  inserted directly into the BLOCK DATA
   file.
 
        Note that this is  designed  only  for  use  with  MNDO  or  AM1
   parameters.   Only  code  for  AM1 will be generated.  To convert the
   FORTRAN code to define MNDO parameters, insert the  letter  M  before
   every left parenthesis;  thus, convert "(" to read "M(".
 
 
                              DEPVAR=n.nn
 
        In polymers the translation vector is frequently a  multiple  of
   some  internal  distance.   For example, in polythene it is the C1-C3
   distance.  If a cluster unit cell of C6H12 is used, then symmetry can
   be  used  to  tie  together  all  the carbon atom coordinates and the
   translation vector distance.  In this  example  DEPVAR=3.0  would  be
   suitable.
 
 
                                 DOUBLET
 
        When a configuration interaction calculation is done,  all  spin
   states  are calculated simultaneously, either for component of spin =
   0 or 1/2.  When only doublet states are of interest, then DOUBLET can
   be  specified,  and  all  other  spin  states,  while calculated, are
   ignored in the choice of root to be used.
 
        Note that while almost every odd-electron  system  will  have  a
   doublet  ground  state,  DOUBLET  should  still  be  specified if the
   desired state must be a doublet.
 
        DOUBLET has no meaning in a UHF calculation.

                                  DRC
 
        An Dynamic Reaction Coordinate calculation is  to  be  run.   By
   default,  total  energy  is  conserved,  so  that  as  the "reaction"
   proceeds in time energy is transferred between kinetic and  potential
   forms.
 
 
                                  ECHO
 
        Data are echoed back if ECHO is specified.  Only useful if  data
   are suspected to be corrupt.
 
 
                                 ENPART
 
        This is a very useful tool for analyzing the energy terms within
   a  system.   The total energy, in eV, obtained by the addition of the
   electronic  and  nuclear  terms,  is  partitioned  into   mono-   and
   bi-centric contributions, and these contributions in turn are divided
   into nuclear and one- and two-electron terms.
 
 
                                  ESR
 
        The unpaired spin density arising from  an  odd-electron  system
   can  be  calculated both RHF and UHF.  In a UHF calculation the alpha
   and beta M.O.s have different spatial forms, so unpaired spin density
   can  naturally  be  present on in-plane hydrogen atoms such as in the
   phenoxy radical.
 
        In the RHF formalism a MECI calculation is  performed.   If  the
   key-words  OPEN and C.I.= are both absent then only a single state is
   calculated.  The unpaired spin density is then  calculated  from  the
   state  function.   In  order  to  have  unpaired  spin density on the
   hydrogens in, for example, the phenoxy radical, several states should
   be mixed.
 
 
                                EXCITED
 
        The state to be  calculated  is  the  first  excited  open-shell
   singlet  state.   If  the  ground  state is a singlet, then the state
   calculated will be S(1);  if the ground  state  is  a  triplet,  then
   S(2).   This  state  would  normally  be  the  state resulting from a
   one-electron excitation from the HOMO to the LUMO.  Exceptions  would
   be  if  the  lowest singlet state were a biradical, in which case the
   EXCITED state could be a closed shell.
 
        The  EXCITED  state  will  be  calculated   from   a   BIRADICAL
   calculation in which the second root of the C.I.  matrix is selected.
   Note that the eigenvector of the C.I.  matrix  is  not  used  in  the
   current formalism.  Abbreviation:  EXCI.

        NOTE:   EXCITED  is  a  redundant  key-word,  and  represents  a
   particular  configuration interaction calculation.  Experienced users
   of MECI can duplicate the effect of the key-word EXCITED by using the
   MECI key-words OPEN(2,2), SINGLET, and ROOT=2.
 
 
                               EXTERNAL=
 
        Normally, AM1 and MNDO parameters are taken from the BLOCK  DATA
   files  within  MOPAC.  When the supplied parameters are not suitable,
   as in an element recently parameterized, and the parameters  not  yet
   installed in the user's copy of MOPAC, then the new parameters can be
   inserted at run time by use of EXTERNAL=<filename>, where  <filename>
   is the name of the file which contains the new parameters.
 
        <filename> consists of a series of parameter definitions in  the
   format
 
        <Parameter> <Element> <Value of parameter>
 
        where the possible parameters are USS, UPP,  UDD,  ZS,  ZP,  ZD,
   BETAS, BETAP, BETAD, GSS, GSP, GPP, GP2, HSP, ALP, FNnm, n=1,2, or 3,
   and m=1 to 10,  and  the  elements  are  defined  by  their  chemical
   symbols, such as Si or SI.
 
        When new parameters for elements  are  published,  they  can  be
   typed  in as shown.  This file is ended by a blank line, the word END
   or  nothing,  i.e.,  no  end-of-file  delimiter.   An  example  of  a
   parameter data file would be
    Line  1:  USS      Si      -34.08201495
    Line  2:  UPP      Si      -28.03211675
    Line  3:  BETAS    Si       -5.01104521

    Line  5:  ZS       Si        1.28184511
    Line  6:  ZP       Si        1.84073175
    Line  7:  ALP      Si        2.18688712
 
        Derived parameters do no need  to  be  entered;   they  will  be
   calculated  from  the  optimized parameters.  All "constants" such as
   the experimental heat of atomization are  already  inserted  for  all
   elements.
 
        NOTE:  EXTERNAL can only be used to input parameters for MNDO or
   AM1.   It is unlikely, however, that any more MINDO/3 parameters will
   be published.

                                  FILL=
 
        The n'th M.O.  in  an  RHF  calculation  is  constrained  to  be
   filled.   It  has  no  effect  on a UHF calculation.  After the first
   iteration (NOTE:  not after the first SCF calculation, but after  the
   first  iteration  within the first SCF calculation) the n'th M.O.  is
   stored, and, if occupied, no further action is taken  at  that  time.
   If  unoccupied, then the HOMO and the n'th M.O.'s are swapped around,
   so that the n'th M.O.  is now filled.  On all  subsequent  iterations
   the  M.O.   nearest  in character to the stored M.O.  is forced to be
   filled,  and  the  stored  M.O.   replaced  by  that  M.O.   This  is
   necessitated  by  the  fact that in a reaction a particular M.O.  may
   change its character very considerably.  A useful procedure is to run
   1SCF and DENOUT first, in order to identify the M.O.'s;  the complete
   job is then run with OLDENS and FILL=nn, so that the eigenvectors  at
   the first iteration are fully known.
 
 
                                  FORCE
 
        A force-calculation is to be run.   The  Hessian,  that  is  the
   matrix  (in  millidynes  per  Angstrom)  of second derivatives of the
   energy with respect to displacements of all pairs of atoms in  x,  y,
   and  z,  is  calculated.   On  diagonalization  this  gives the force
   constants for the molecule.  The force matrix, weighted for  isotopic
   masses,  is  then  used  for calculating the vibrational frequencies.
   The system can be characterized as a ground  state  or  a  transition
   state  by  the  presence  of  five  (for  a  linear  system)  or  six
   eigenvalues which are very  small  (less  than  about  30  reciprocal
   centimeters).   A  transition  state is further characterized by one,
   and exactly one, negative force constant.
 
        A FORCE calculation is a prerequisite for a THERMO calculation.
 
        Before a FORCE calculation is started, a check is made to ensure
   that   a  stationary  point  is  being  used.   This  check  involves
   calculating the gradient norm (GNORM) and if it is  significant,  the
   GNORM  will  be  reduced using NLLSQ (Bartel's method).  All internal
   coordinates are optimized, and any symmetry constraints  are  ignored
   at  this  point.  An implication of this is that if the specification
   of the geometry relies on  any  angles  being  exactly  180  or  zero
   degrees, the calculation may fail.
 
        The geometric definition supplied to FORCE should  not  rely  on
   angles  or  dihedrals  assuming  exact  values.   (The  test of exact
   linearity is sufficiently slack that most molecules that are  linear,
   such  as  acetylene  and  but-2-yne, should not be stopped.) See also
   THERMO, LET, TRANS, ISOTOPE.

                                 FULSCF
 
        In  line-searches  the  option  exists  to  require  all  energy
   evaluations  to  be  done using full SCF calculations.  Normally full
   SCF calculations are not carried out during  a  line  search  as  the
   density  matrix  is  normally  not  changing  very  fast.   The  only
   important exception is in non-variationally optimized  wavefunctions,
   such as occur in half-electron or C.I.  calculations.
 
 
                                 GEO-OK
 
        Normally the program will stop with a  warning  message  if  two
   atoms  are  within  0.8 Angstroms of each other, or (more rarely) the
   D.F.P.  routine has difficulty optimizing the geometry.  GEO-OK  will
   over-ride  the job termination sequence, and allow the calculation to
   proceed.  In practice most jobs that terminate due  to  these  checks
   contain  errors  in data, so caution should be exercised if GEO-OK is
   used.  An important exception  to  this  warning  is  if  the  system
   contains, or may give rise to, a Hydrogen molecule.
 
 
                                 GNORM=
 
        The D.F.P.  geometry optimization termination  criteria  can  be
   over-ridden  by specifying a gradient norm requirement.  For example,
   GNORM=20 would allow the D.F.P.  to exit as soon as the gradient norm
   dropped  below  20.0,  the  default being 1.0.  A GNORM=0.01 could be
   used to refine a geometry beyond the normal limits.  WARNING:   If  a
   very  small  value is chosen, the D.F.P.  procedure may not terminate
   in a reasonable time.  A reasonable lower bound for GNORM is 0.1.
 
 
                                GRADIENTS
 
        In a 1SCF calculation gradients are not calculated  by  default:
   in  non-variationally  optimized systems this would take an excessive
   time.   GRADIENTS  allows  the  gradients  to  be  calculated.    All
   gradients are then calculated, whether marked for calculation or not,
   and printed.  An exception is when the 1SCF was used  in  conjunction
   with  the  key-word RESTART, in which case only the coordinates being
   optimized would have their gradients printed.  Abbreviation:  GRAD
 
 
                                 GRAPH
 
        Information needed to generate electron density contour maps can
   be  written to a file by calling GRAPH.  GRAPH first enters MULLIK in
   order to generate the  inverse-square-root  of  the  overlap  matrix,
   which  is required for the re-normalization of the eigenvectors.  All
   data essential for the graphics package, q.v., are then output.

   In  an  DRC  calculation,  results  will  be  printed  whenever   the

                               DRC=n.nnn
 
        In an DRC calculation,  the  "half-life"  for  loss  of  kinetic
   energy  is  defined  as  n.nnn x 10 femtoseconds.  If n.nnn is set to
   zero, infinite damping simulating a very condensed phase is obtained.
 
 
                                ISOTOPE
 
        The FORCE matrix is very  time-consuming  to  generate,  and  in
   isotopic substitution studies several vibrational calculations may be
   needed.   To  allow  the  frequencies  to  be  calculated  from   the
   (constant)  force  matrix, ISOTOPE is used.  When a FORCE calculation
   is completed, ISOTOPE will cause  the  force  matrix  to  be  stored,
   regardless of whether or not any intervening restarts have been made.
   To re-calculate the frequencies, etc., starting at  the  end  of  the
   force matrix calculation specify RESTART.
 
        The two key-words RESTART and ISOTOPE can be used together.  For
   example, if a normal FORCE calculation runs for a long time, the user
   may want to divide it up into stages and save the final force matrix.
   Once ISOTOPE has been used, it does not need to be used on subsequent
   RESTART runs.
 
 
                                ITRY=NN
 
        The default maximum number of SCF iterations is 200.  When  this
   limit  presents difficulty, ITRY=nn can be used to re-define it.  For
   example, if ITRY=400 is used, the maximum number of  iterations  will
   be  set  to 400.  ITRY should normally not be changed until all other
   means of obtaining a SCF have been exhausted, e.g.  SHIFT  and  PULAY
   etc.
 
 
                             KINETIC=n.nnn
 
        In an DRC calculation n.nnn Kcals/mole of excess kinetic  energy
   is added to the system as soon as the kinetic energy builds up to 0.2
   Kcal/mole.  The excess  energy  is  added  to  the  velocity  vector,
   without change of direction.

                                  LET
 
        Before the Hessian matrix is calculated in a  FORCE  calculation
   the  geometry  will  be refined by a gradient minimization routine if
   the gradient norm is significant.  If the  user  does  not  want  the
   refinement  to  be  carried  out,  then  LET  is  provided to let the
   calculation proceed.
 
 
                                LOCALIZE
 
        The occupied eigenvectors are transformed into a  localized  set
   of  M.O.'s  by  a series of 2 by 2 rotations which maximize <psiD4U>.
   The value of 1/<psiD4U> is a direct measure of the number of  centers
   involved in the M.O., thus for H2 the value of 1/<psiD4U> is 2.0, for
   a three-center bond is 3.0, and a lone pair  would  be  1.0.   Higher
   degeneracies than allowed by point group theory are readily obtained.
   For example, benzene would give rise to a 6-fold degenerate C-H bond,
   a 6-fold degenerate C-C sigma bond and a three-fold degenerate C-C pi
   bond.  In principle, there is no single step method to  unambiguously
   obtain  the  most  localized  set  of M.O.'s in systems where several
   canonical structures are possible, just as no  simple  method  exists
   for  finding  the  most  stable  conformer  of  some  large compound.
   However,  the  localized  bonds  generated  will  normally  be  quite
   acceptable for routine applications.  Abbreviation:  LOCAL

                                MICROS=n
 
        The microstates used by MECI are normally generated by use of  a
   permutation  operator.   When  individually  defined  microstates are
   desired, then MICROS=n can be used, where n  defines  the  number  of
   microstates to be read in.
 
                         Format for Microstates
 
        After the geometry data plus any symmetry data are read in, data
   defining   each  microstate  is  read  in,  using  format  20I1,  one
   microstate per line.
 
        For a system with n M.O.s  in  the  C.I.   (use  OPEN=(n1,n)  or
   C.I.=n to do this), the populations of the n alpha M.O.s are defined,
   followed by the n beta M.O.s.  Allowed occupancies are zero and  one.
   For   n=6   the   closed-shell  ground  state  would  be  defined  as
   111000111000, meaning one electron in each of the first  three  alpha
   M.O.s, and one electron in each of the first three beta M.O.s.
 
        Users are warned that they are responsible  for  completing  any
   spin manifolds.  Thus while the state 111100110000 is a triplet state
   with component of spin = 1, the state 111000110100,  while  having  a
   component  of  spin = 0 is neither a singlet nor a triplet.  In order
   to complete the spin manifold the microstate 110100111000  must  also
   be included.
 
        If  a  manifold  of  spin  states  is  not  complete,  then  the
   eigenstates  of the spin operator will not be quantized.  When 100 or
   fewer microstates are supplied, this is the only  cause  of  loss  of
   spin quantization.
 
        There are two other limitations on possible microstates.  First,
   the  number  of electrons in every microstate should be the same.  If
   they differ, a warning message will be printed, and  the  calculation
   continued  (but  the  results  will  almost  certainly  be nonsense).
   Second, the component of spin for every microstate must be the  same,
   except   for   teaching   purposes.   Two  microstates  of  different
   components of spin will have a zero matrix element  connecting  them.
   No  warning  will  be  given  as  this is a reasonable operation in a
   teaching situation.  For example, if  all  states  arising  from  two
   electrons  in  two  levels  are  to  be  calculated, say for teaching
   Russel-Saunders coupling, then the  following  microstates  would  be
   used:
         Microstate       No. of alpha, beta electrons  Ms  State
 
           1100                    2     0              1   Triplet
           1010                    1     1              0   Singlet

        Constraints on the space manifold are just as rigorous, but much
   easier  to  satisfy.   If  the energy levels are degenerate, then all
   components of  a  manifold  of  degenerate  M.O.s  should  be  either

   included  or  excluded.   If  only  some, but not all, components are
   used, the required degeneracy of the states will be missing.
 
        As an example, for the tetrahedral methane cation, if  the  user
   supplies  the microstates corresponding to a component of spin = 3/2,
   neglecting Jahn-Teller distortion, the minimum number of states  that
   can be supplied is 90 = (6!/(1!.5!))*(6!/(4!.2!)).
 
        While the total number of electrons should be the same  for  all
   microstates,  this  number does not need to be the same as the number
   of electrons supplied to the C.I.;  thus  in  the  example  above,  a
   cationic state could be 110000111000.
 
        The format is defined as 20I1 so that spaces  can  be  used  for
   empty M.O.s.
 
 
                                 MINDO/3
 
        The  default  Hamiltonian  within  MOPAC  is  MNDO,   with   the
   alternatives  of AM1 and MINDO/3.  To use the MINDO/3 Hamiltonian the
   key-word MINDO/3 should be  used.   Acceptable  alternatives  to  the
   key-word MINDO/3 are MINDO and MINDO3.

        A full Mulliken Population analysis is to be done on  the  final
   RHF wavefunction.  This involves the following steps:
       (1) The eigenvector matrix is divided by the square root
           of the overlap matrix, S.
       (2) The Coulson-type density matrix, P, is formed.
       (3) The overlap population is formed from P(i,j)*S(i,j).
       (4) Half the off-diagonals are added onto the diagonals.

                                 NLLSQ
 
        The gradient norm is to be minimized by Bartel's  method.   This
   is   a   Non-Linear  Least  Squares  gradient  minimization  routine.
   Gradient minimization will locate one of three possible points:
 
        (a) A minimum in the energy surface.  The gradient norm will  go
   to  zero,  and  the  lowest  five or six eigenvalues resulting from a
   FORCE calculation will be approximately zero.
 
        (b) A transition state.  The gradient norm will  vanish,  as  in
   (a),  but  in  this case the system is characterized by one, and only
   one, negative force constant.
 
        (c) A local  minimum  in  the  gradient  norm  space.   In  this
   (normally unwanted) case the gradient norm is minimized, but does not
   go to zero.  A FORCE calculation will not give the five or  six  zero
   eigenvalues  characteristic  of  a  stationary point.  While normally
   undesirable, this is sometimes the only way  to  obtain  a  geometry.
   For  instance, if a system is formed which cannot be characterized as
   an intermediate, and at the same time is not a transition state,  but
   nonetheless  has  some  chemical significance, then that state can be
   refined using NLLSQ.
 
 
                                 OLDENS
 
        A density matrix produced by an earlier run of MOPAC  is  to  be
   used  to start the current calculation.  This can be used in attempts
   to obtain a SCF when a previous calculation ended successfully but  a
   subsequent run failed to go SCF.
 
 
                               OPEN(n1,n2)
 
        The M.O.  occupancy during the SCF calculation can be defined in
   terms  of  doubly  occupied,  empty, and fractionally occupied M.O.s.
   The fractionally occupied M.O.s are defined by OPEN(n1,n2), where  n1
   =  number of electrons in the open-shell manifold, and n2 = number of
   open-shell M.O.s;  n1 must be in the range 0 to  2  x  n2.   OPEN(1,)
   will  be  assumed  for odd-electron systems unless an OPEN keyword is
   used.   Errors  introduced  by  use  of  fractional   occupancy   are
   automatically  corrected  in  a  MECI calculation when OPEN(n1,n2) is
   used.
 
 
                                   PI
 
        The normal density matrix is composed of atomic  orbitals,  that
   is  s,  px,  py and pz.  PI allows the user to see how each atom-atom
   interaction is split into sigma and pi bonds.  The resulting "density
   matrix"  is  composed  of  the  following  basis-functions:- s-sigma,
   p-sigma, p-pi, d-sigma, d-pi, d-dell.  The on-diagonal terms give the
   hybridization  state,  so  that  an  sp2  hybridized  system would be
   represented as s-sigma 1.0, p-sigma 2.0, p-pi 1.0

                                PRECISE
 
        The criteria for terminating all optimizations,  electronic  and
   geometric,  are to be increased by a factor of 100.  This can be used
   where more precise results are wanted.  If the results are  going  to
   be  used in a FORCE calculation, where the geometry needs to be known
   quite precisely, then PRECISE is recommended;  for small systems  the
   extra cost in CPU time is minimal.
 
 
                                 PULAY
 
        The default converger in the SCF calculation is to  be  replaced
   by  Pulay's  procedure  as soon as the density matrix is sufficiently
   stable.  A considerable improvement in speed can be achieved  by  the
   use of PULAY.  If a large number of SCF calculations are envisaged, a
   sample calculation using 1SCF and PULAY should be compared with using
   1SCF  on  its own, and if a saving in time results, then PULAY should
   be used in the full calculation.  PULAY should be used with  care  in
   that  its use will prevent the combined package of convergers (SHIFT,
   PULAY and the CAMP-KING convergers) from automatically being used  in
   the event that the system fails to go SCF in (ITRY-10) iterations.
 
        The combined set of convergers very seldom fails.
 
 
                                 QUARTET
 
        The desired spin-state is a quartet.  That is,  the  state  with
   component  of  spin  =  3/2  and  spin  =  3/2.  When a configuration
   interaction calculation is done, all spin states of spin equal to, or
   greater than 3/2 are calculated simultaneously, for component of spin
   = 3/2.  From these  states  the  quartet  states  are  selected  when
   QUARTET  is  specified,  and all other spin states, while calculated,
   are ignored in the choice of root to be used.  If QUARTET is used  on
   its  own,  then a single state, corresponding to an alpha electron in
   each of three M.O.s is calculated.
 
        QUARTET has no meaning in a UHF calculation.

        The desired spin-state is a quintet, that  is,  the  state  with
   component of spin = 2 and spin = 2.  When a configuration interaction
   calculation is done, all spin states of spin  equal  to,  or  greater
   than  2  are  calculated  simultaneously,  for component of spin = 2.
   From these states the quintet states are  selected  when  QUINTET  is
   specified,  and  the septet states, while calculated, will be ignored
   in the choice of root to be used.  If QUINTET is  used  on  its  own,
   then  a  single  state, corresponding to an alpha electron in each of
   four M.O.s is calculated.
 
        QUINTET has no meaning in a UHF calculation.
 
 
                                 RESTART
 
        When  a  job  has  been  stopped,  for  whatever   reason,   and
   intermediate  results  have  been stored, then the calculation can be
   restarted at the point where it stopped by specifying  RESTART.   The
   most  common  cause  of  a  job  stopping  before  completion  is its
   exceeding the time allocated.   A  saddle-point  calculation  has  no
   restart, but the output file contains information which can easily be
   used to start the calculation from a point near to where it stopped.
 
        It is not necessary to change the geometric data to reflect  the
   new  geometry,  as  a  result  the geometry printed at the start of a
   restarted job will be that of the original  data,  not  that  of  the
   restarted file.
 
        A convenient way to monitor a long run is to  specify  1SCF  and
   RESTART;  this will give a normal output file at very little cost.
 
        NOTE:  In a FORCE calculation two restarts are possible.   These
   are (a) a restart in NLLSQ or FLEPO if the geometry was not optimized
   fully before FORCE was called, and (b)  the  normal  restart  in  the
   construction  of  the  force  matrix.   If the restart is in FLEPO or
   NLLSQ within FORCE then the key-word FORCE should be deleted, and the
   key-word  RESTART  used  on  its  own,  or  with  NLLSQ if necessary.
   Forgetting this point is a frequent cause of failed jobs.
 
 
                                 ROOT=n
 
        The n'th root of a C.I.   calculation  is  to  be  used  in  the
   calculation.   If  a  key-word  specifying  the  spin-state  is  also
   present, e.g.  SINGLET or TRIPLET, then the n'th root of  that  state
   will  be  selected.   Thus  ROOT=3  and SINGLET will select the third
   singlet root.  If ROOT=3 is used on its own, then the third root will
   be  used,  which  may  be a triplet, the third singlet, or the second
   singlet (the second root might be a triplet).  In  normal  use,  this
   key-word  would  not  be  used.   It  is retained for educational and
   research purposes.  Unusual care should be exercised  when  ROOT=  is
   specified.

        In the  calculation  of  the  rotational  contributions  to  the
   thermodynamic  quantities the symmetry number of the molecule must be
   supplied.  The symmetry number of a point  group  is  the  number  of
   equivalent positions attainable by pure rotations.  No reflections or
   improper rotations are allowed.  This number  cannot  be  assumed  by
   default, and may be affected by subtle modifications to the molecule,
   such as isotopic substitution.  A list of the most important symmetry
   numbers follows:

                                  SADDLE
 
        The transition state in a simple  chemical  reaction  is  to  be
   optimized.   Extra  data  are  required.   After  the first geometry,
   specifying the  reactants,  and  any  symmetry  functions  have  been
   defined,  the  second  geometry, specifying the products, is defined,
   using the same format as that of the first geometry.
 
        SADDLE often fails to work successfully.  Frequently this is due
   to  dihedral  angles being different by about 360 degrees rather than
   zero degrees.  As the choice of  dihedral  can  be  difficult,  users
   should  consider  running  this  calculation  with  the key-word XYZ.
   There is  normally  no  ambiguity  in  the  definition  of  cartesian
   coordinates.
 
 
                                 SCFCRT=
 
        The default SCF criterion is to be replaced by that  defined  by
   SCFCRT=.   The  SCF  criterion  can  be  varied  from about 0.0001 to
   0.0000000001.  To find a suitable value 1SCF and  various  values  of
   SCFCRT=n.nnn should be used;  a SCFCRT which allows evaluation of the
   heat of formation to  an  acceptable  precision  can  thus  be  found
   rapidly.   An overly tight criterion can lead to failure to achieve a
   SCF, and consequent failure of the run.

        The desired spin-state is a sextet:  the state with component of
   spin = 5/2 and spin = 5/2.
 
        The  sextet  states  are  the  highest  spin   states   normally
   calculable  using MOPAC in its unmodified form.  If SEXTET is used on
   its own, then single state, corresponding to one  alpha  electron  in
   each  of  five  M.O.s,  is  calculated.  If several sextets are to be
   calculated, say the second or third, then OPEN(n1,n2) should be used.
 
        SEXTET has no meaning in a UHF calculation.
 
 
                                  SHIFT=
 
        In an attempt to obtain an SCF by damping oscillations which are
   slowing  down  the  convergence  or  preventing a SCF being achieved,
   SHIFT can be used.  The principle is that if the virtual  M.O.'s  are
   raised   in   energy   relative   to   the  occupied  set,  then  the
   polarizability of the occupied M.O.'s will decrease, the oscillations
   being attributed to autoregenerative charge fluctuations.  A SHIFT of
   20 will raise the virtual M.O.'s by 20 eV above their correct  value.
   The disadvantage of SHIFT is that a large value can lead to excessive
   damping, and thus prevent an SCF being generated.   As  some  virtual
   M.O.'s  are used in non-variationally optimized calculations SHIFT is
   automatically annulled at the end of the SCF in these  circumstances.
   All  effects  of  SHIFT  are  removed before the results are printed.
   SHIFT should be used with care in that the use of any value for SHIFT
   will prevent the combined package of convergers (SHIFT, PULAY and the
   CAMP-KING convergers) from automatically being used in event that the
   system fails to go SCF in (ITRY-10) iterations.
 
        The combined set of convergers almost never fails.

        The McIver-Komornicki gradient norm minimization routines, POWSQ
   and SEARCH are to be used.  These are very rapid routines, but do not
   work for all species.  If the gradient norm is low, i.e.,  less  than
   about  5  units, then SIGMA will probably work;  in most cases, NLLSQ
   is recommended.  SIGMA first  calculates  a  quite  accurate  Hessian
   matrix,  a slow step, then works out the direction of fastest decent,
   and  searches  along  that  direction  until  the  gradient  norm  is
   minimized.  The Hessian is then partially updated in light of the new
   gradients, and a fresh  search  direction  found.   Clearly,  if  the
   Hessian  changes  markedly as a result of the line-search, the update
   done will be inaccurate, and the new search direction will be faulty.
 
        Of course, SIGMA should be  avoided  if  at  all  possible  when
   non-variationally optimized calculations are being done.

        When a configuration interaction calculation is done,  all  spin
   states  are calculated simultaneously, either for component of spin =
   0 or 1/2.  When only singlet states are of interest, then SINGLET can
   be  specified,  and  all  other  spin  states,  while calculated, are
   ignored in the choice of root to be used.
 
        Note that while almost every even-electron system  will  have  a
   singlet  ground  state,  SINGLET  should  still  be  specified if the
   desired state must be a singlet.
 
        SINGLET has no meaning  in  a  UHF  calculation,  but  see  also

   closed-shell ground state, e.g.  methane run  UHF,  the  spin  matrix
   will be null.
 
        If SPIN is not requested in a UHF calculation, then the diagonal

                                SYMMETRY
 
        Symmetry  data  defining  related  bond  lengths,   angles   and
   dihedrals  can  be  included  by  supplying additional data after the
   geometry has been entered.  If there are  any  other  data,  such  as
   values  for  the  reaction  coordinates,  or  a  second  geometry, as
   required by SADDLE, then it would follow the symmetry data.  Symmetry
   data  are  terminated  by  one  blank  line.   For  non-variationally
   optimized systems symmetry constraints can save a lot of time because
   many  derivatives  do  not  need to be calculated.  At the same time,
   there is a risk that the geometry may be wrongly specified, e.g.   if
   methane radical cation is defined as being tetrahedral, no indication
   that this is faulty will be given until a FORCE calculation  is  run.
   (This system undergoes spontaneous Jahn-Teller distortion.)

        Usually a lower heat of formation can be obtained when  SYMMETRY
   is  specified.   To see why, consider the geometry of benzene.  If no
   assumptions are made regarding the geometry, then all  the  C-C  bond
   lengths  will  be  very  slightly  different,  and the angles will be
   almost, but not quite 120 degrees.  Fixing all angles at 120 degrees,
   dihedrals  at  180  or 0 degrees, and only optimizing one C-C and one
   C-H bond-length will result in a 2-D optimization,  and  exact  DU6hD
   symmetry.   Any deformation from this symmetry must involve error, so
   by imposing symmetry some error is removed.
 
        The layout of the symmetry data is:
     <defining atom> <symmetry relation> <defined atom> <defined atom>,...

                                   T=
 
        This is a facility to allow the  program  to  shut  down  in  an
   orderly manner on computers with execution time C.P.U.  limits.
 
        The total C.P.U.  time allowed for the current job is limited to
   nn.nn  seconds;  by default this is one hour, i.e., 3600 seconds.  If
   the next cycle of the calculation cannot be completed without running
   a  risk  of  exceeding the assigned time the calculation will write a
   restart file and then stop.  The safety margin is 100 percent;   that
   is,  to  do another cycle, enough time to do at least two full cycles
   must remain.
 
        An alternative specification is T=nn.nnM, this  allows  time  in
   minutes  to  be  defined,  thus T=60M will define 3600 seconds, or 60
   minutes.

                                 THERMO
 
        The thermodynamic quantities  internal  energy,  heat  capacity,
   partition  function,  and  entropy can be calculated for translation,
   rotation and vibrational degrees of freedom for a single temperature,
   or  a  range  of  temperatures.   Special  situations  such as linear
   systems and transition states are accommodated.   The  approximations
   used  in  the THERMO calculation are invalid below 100K, and checking
   of the lower bound of  the  temperature  range  is  done  to  prevent
   temperatures of less than 100K being used.
 
        Another limitation, for which no checking is done, is that there
   should  be  no  internal  rotations.   If any exist, they will not be
   recognized as such, and the calculated quantities will be too low  as
   a result.
 
        If THERMO is specified on its own, then the  default  values  of
   the temperature range are assumed.  This starts at 200K and increases
   in steps of 10 degrees to 400K.  Three options exist  for  overriding
   the default temperature range.  These are:
 
 
                              THERMO(nnn)
 
        The  thermodynamic  quantities  for  a  200  degree   range   of
   temperatures, starting at nnnK and with an interval of 10 degrees are
   to be calculated.
 
 
                            THERMO(nnn,mmm)
 
        The thermodynamic quantities for the temperature  range  limited
   by  a lower bound of nnn Kelvin and an upper bound of mmm Kelvin, the
   step size being calculated in order to give approximately 20  points,
   and  a reasonable value for the step.  The size of the step in Kelvin
   degrees will be 1, 2, or 5, or a power of 10 times these numbers.
 
 
                           THERMO(nnn,mmm,lll)
 
        As for THERMO(nnn,mmm) only now the user can  explicitly  define
   the step size.  The step size cannot be less than 1K.

   In  an  DRC  calculation,  results  will  be  printed  whenever   the

                                 TRANS
 
        The  imaginary  frequency  due  to  the  reaction  vector  in  a
   transition   state   calculation   must   not   be  included  in  the
   thermochemical  calculation.   The  number  of   genuine   vibrations
   considered can be:
 
        3N-5 for a linear ground state system,
 
        3N-6 for a non-linear ground state system, or
 
        3N-6 for a linear transition-state complex,
 
        3N-7 for a non-linear transition-state complex.
 
        This key-word must be used  in  conjunction  with  THERMO  if  a
   transition state is being calculated.
 
 
                                TRANS=n
 
        The facility exists to allow the THERMO  calculation  to  handle
   systems  with  internal  rotations.  TRANS=n will remove the n lowest
   vibrations.  Note that TRANS=1 is equivalent to  TRANS  on  its  own.
   For xylene, for example, TRANS=2 would be suitable.
 
 
                                TRIPLET
 
        The triplet state is defined.  If the system has an  odd  number
   of electrons, an error message will be printed.
 
        UHF interpretation
 
        The number of alpha electrons exceeds that of the beta electrons
   by  2.   If  TRIPLET  is not specified, then the numbers of alpha and
   beta electrons are set equal.  This does not  necessarily  correspond
   to a singlet.
 
        RHF interpretation.
 
        A RHF MECI calculation is performed  to  calculate  the  triplet
   state.   If no other C.I.  key-words are used, then only one state is
   calculated by default.   The  occupancy  of  the  M.O.s  in  the  SCF
   calculation  is  defined as (...2,1,1,0,..), that is, one electron is
   put in each of the two highest occupied M.O.s.
 
        See key-words C.I.=n and OPEN(n1,n2).
 
 
                                   UHF
 
        The unrestricted Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is to be used.

                                 VECTORS
 
        The eigenvectors are to be printed.  In  UHF  calculations  both
   alpha  and beta eigenvectors are printed;  in all cases the full set,
   occupied and virtual, are output.  The eigenvectors are normalized to
   unity,  that is the sum of the squares of the coefficients is exactly
   one.  If DEBUG is specified, then ALL eigenvectors on every iteration
   of  every  SCF  calculation  will  be  printed.   This is useful in a
   learning context, but would normally be very undesirable.
 
 
                               X-PRIORITY
   In  an  DRC  calculation,  results  will  be  printed  whenever   the
   calculated  geometry  changes by 0.05 Angstroms.  The geometry change
   is defined as the linear sum of the translation vectors of motion for
   all atoms in the system.  Abbreviation, X-PRIO.
 
 
                            X-PRIORITY=n.nn
   In  an  DRC  calculation,  results  will  be  printed  whenever   the
   calculated geometry changes by n.nn Angstroms.
 
 
                                  XYZ
 
        The  SADDLE  calculation  quite  often  fails  due   to   faulty
   definition of the second geometry because the dihedrals give a lot of
   difficulty.  To make this option easier to use,  XYZ  was  developed.
   Using  XYZ  the  calculation  runs entirely in cartesian coordinates,
   this  eliminating  the  problems  associated  with  dihedrals.    The
   connectivity  of  the two systems can be different, but the numbering
   must be the same.  Dummy atoms can be used;  these will be removed at
   the  start  of  the run.  A new numbering system will be generated by
   the program, when necessary.

                         GEOMETRY SPECIFICATION
 
 
 
 
 
        FORMAT:  The geometry is read in using essentially "Free-Format"
   of  FORTRAN-77.   In  fact,  a  character  input  is used in order to
   accommodate the  chemical  symbols,  but  the  numeric  data  can  be
   regarded as "free-format".  This means that integers and real numbers
   can be interspersed, numbers can be separated by one or more  spaces,
   a  tab  and/or by one comma.  If a number is not specified, its value
   is set to zero.
 
        The geometry can be defined  in  terms  of  either  internal  or
   cartesian coordinates.
 
        INTERNAL COORDINATE DEFINITION
 
        For any one atom (i) this consists of an interatomic distance in
   Angstroms  from  an already-defined atom (j), an interatomic angle in
   degrees between atom i and j and an already defined k, (k and j  must
   be different atoms), and finally a torsional angle in degrees between
   atom i, j, k, and an already defined atom l (l cannot be the same  as
   k or j)
 
        Exceptions:
 
   1.  Atom 1 has no coordinates at all:  this is the origin.
 
   2.  Atom 2 must be connected to atom 1  by  an  interatomic  distance
       only.
 
   3.  Atom 3 can be connected to atom 1 or 2, and must  make  an  angle
       with  atom  2  or  1  (thus  -  3-2-1  or 3-1-2);  no dihedral is
       possible for atom 3.  By default, atom 3 is connected to atom 2.

                         GEOMETRY SPECIFICATION
 
 
   3.1  CONSTRAINTS:
 
 
   1.  Interatomic distances must be greater than zero.  Zero  Angstroms
       is  not  acceptable.   The  only exception is if the parameter is
       symmetry-related to another atom, and is the dependent function.
 
   2.  Angles must be positive.  This constraint is for the  benefit  of
       the  user  only;  negative angles are the result of errors in the
       construction of the geometry.
 
   3.  Dihedrals can normally only assume definable angles.  If  atom  i
       makes  a  dihedral with atoms j, k, and l, and the three atoms j,
       k, and l are in  a  straight  line,  then  the  dihedral  has  no
       definable  angle.   During  the  calculation  this  constraint is
       checked continuously, and if atoms j, k, and  l  lie  within  0.1
       Angstroms of a straight line the calculation will output an error
       message and then stop.  Two exceptions to this constraint are:
 
            (a) if the angle is zero or 180 degrees, in which  case  the
       dihedral is not used.
 
            (b) if atoms j, k, and l lie in  an  exactly  straight  line
       (usually  the  result of a symmetry constraint), as in acetylene,
       acetonitrile, but-2-yne, etc.
 
 
        If the exceptions are used, care must be taken  to  ensure  that
   the   program   does   not   violate  these  constraints  during  any
   optimizations or during any calculations of derivatives  -  see  also
   FORCE.
 
        CARTESIAN COORDINATE DEFINITION
 
        Cartesian coordinates consist of the chemical symbol  or  atomic
   number,  then the cartesian coordinates and optimization flags but no
   connectivity.
 
        MOPAC uses the lack of connectivity to indicate  that  cartesian
   coordinates  are  to  be  used.   A unique case is the triatomics for
   which only internal  coordinates  are  allowed.   This  is  to  avoid
   conflict  of  definitions:   the  user  does  not  need to define the
   connectivity of atom 2, and can elect to use the default connectivity
   for  atom  3.   As  a  result,  a  triatomic  may  have  no  explicit
   connectivity defined, the user thus taking advantage of  the  default
   connectivity.  Since internal coordinates are more commonly used than
   cartesian, the above choice was made.
 
        If the key-word XYZ is absent  then  every  coordinate  must  be
   marked for optimization.  If any coordinates are not to be optimized,
   then the key-word XYZ must be present.  The coordinates of all atoms,
   including  atoms 1, 2 and 3 can be optimized.  Dummy atoms should not
   be used, for obvious reasons.

        Elements 103, 104, 105, and 106 are the sparkles;   elements  3,
   11 and 19 are sparkles tailored to look like the alkaline metal ions;
   Tv is the translation vector for polymer calculations.
 
        Element 99, or XX is known as a dummy atom, and is used  in  the
   definition  of  the  geometry;   it is deleted automatically from any
   cartesian coordinate geometry files.  Dummy atoms are pure mathematic
   points,  and  are  useful  in  defining  geometries;  for example, in
   ammonia the definition of CU3vD symmetry is facilitated by using  one
   dummy atom and symmetry relating the three hydrogens to it.
 
        Output normally only gives chemical symbols.
 
        Isotopes are used in conjunction with chemical symbols.   If  no
   isotope  is  specified,  the  average  isotopic  mass  is  used, thus
   chlorine is 35.453.  This is different from all previous versions  of
   MOPAC,  in which the most abundant isotope was used by default.  This
   change is justified by the removal of any ambiguity in the choice  of
   isotope.   Also,  the  experimental  vibrational  spectra  involve  a
   mixture of isotopes.  If  a  user  wishes  to  specify  any  specific
                                  3-3
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   isotope  it should immediately follow the chemical symbol (no space),
   thus:  H2, H2.0140, C13, C13.00335.
 
        The sparkles ++, +, --, and - have no mass;  if they are  to  be
   used in a force calculation, then appropriate masses should be used.
 
        Each internal coordinate is followed by an integer, to  indicate
   the action to be taken.
      Integer                        Action
 
        1                Optimize the internal coordinate.
        0                Do not optimize the internal coordinate.
       -1                Reaction coordinate, or grid index.
 
        Remarks:
 
        Only one reaction coordinate is allowed, but this  can  be  made
   more  versatile  by the use of SYMMETRY.  If a reaction coordinate is
   used, the values of the reaction coordinate should follow immediately
   after the geometry and any symmetry data.  No terminator is required,
   and free-format-type input is acceptable.
 
        If two "reaction coordinates" are used, then MOPAC assumes  that
   the  two-dimensional  space in the region of the supplied geometry is
   to be mapped.  The two dimensions to  be  mapped  are  in  the  plane
   defined by the "-1" labels.  Step sizes in the two directions must be
   supplied using STEP1 and STEP2 on the key-word line.
 
        Using  internal  coordinates,   the   first   atom   has   three
   unoptimizable  coordinates, the second atom two, (the bond-length can
   be optimized) and the third atom has  one  unoptimizable  coordinate.
   None  of  these  six  unoptimizable  coordinates  at the start of the
   geometry should be marked for optimization.  If any are so marked,  a
   warning is given, and the calculation will continue.
 
        In cartesian coordinates all parameters can be optimized.
 
 
 
 
 
   3.3  EXAMPLES OF COORDINATE DEFINITIONS.
 
        First, formaldehyde.  By definition atom 1, here oxygen,  is  at
   the  origin.   Atom  2 is defined as being along the "x" axis, and is
   bonded to atom 1.  Because of these definitions, the  user  does  not
   need to specify the connectivity of atom 2, but can do so if desired.
   Further, by default, but not by definition, atom 3  is  connected  to
   atom  2,  and makes an angle with atom 1.  If the user wishes, either
   the default connectivity for atom 3, or the alternative connectivity,
   to atom 1, making an angle with atom 2, can be explicitly defined.
 
        In this example,  the  minimum  data  necessary  to  define  the
   geometry  has  been entered.  Thus for atoms 2 and 3 the connectivity
   has been omitted:  the default connectivity is  used.   For  atom  4,
   however,  the  full  connectivity  must  be  explicitly  defined;  no
                                  3-4
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   defaults are allowed.
     O                                    The first atom has no coordinates.

                                          SYMMETRY must have been specified, in
    order to not have to give a bond-length or an angle. The dihedral is point-
    group defined as 180 degrees.
 
 
 
 
        MOPAC can generate data-files, both in the Archive files, and at
   the end of the normal output file, when a job ends prematurely due to
   time restrictions.  Here the coordinate definition for formic acid is
   shown.
 
        Note  that  all  coordinates  are  generated,  as  is  the  full
   connectivity.   Also,  the data are all neatly lined up.  This is, of
   course, characteristic of machine-generated data, but is useful  when
   checking for errors.

        Polymers are defined by the presence of  a  translation  vector.
   In  the following example, polyethylene, the translation vector spans
   three monomeric units, and is  7.7  Angstroms  long.   Note  in  this
   example  the  presence  of  two dummy atoms.  These not only make the
   geometry definition easier but also allow the translation  vector  to
   be specified in terms of distance only, rather than both distance and
   angles.

                                EXAMPLES
 
 
 
 
 
        In this chapter various examples of  data-files  are  described.
   With  MOPAC  comes two sets of data for running calculations.  One of
   these is called MNRSD1.DAT, and this will now be described.
 
 
 
 
 
   4.1  MNRSD1 TEST DATA FILE FOR FORMALDEHYDE
 
        The following  file  is  suitable  for  generating  the  results
   described  in  the  next section, and would be suitable for debugging
   data.

                                EXAMPLES
 
 
    These two data-files will produce identical results files.
 
      In all geometric specifications care must be taken in defining the
 internal coordinates to ensure that no three atoms being used to define
 a fourth atom's dihedral angle ever fall into a  straight  line.   This
 can  happen  in  the  course  of  a  geometry optimization, in a SADDLE
 calculation or in following a reaction coordinate.  If such a condition
 should  develop,  then  the position of the dependent atom would become
 ill-defined.

        NOTE 1:  The banner indicates whether  the  calculation  uses  a
   MNDO, MINDO/3 or AM1 Hamiltonian;  here, the default MNDO Hamiltonian
   is used.
 
        NOTE 2:  The Version number is a constant  for  any  release  of
   MOPAC,  and refers to the program, not to the Hamiltonians used.  The
   version number should be cited in any correspondence regarding MOPAC.
 
        All the key-words used, along with a brief  explanation,  should
   be  printed  at  this time.  If a key-word is not printed, it has not
   been recognized by the program.  Key-words can be in upper  or  lower
   case letters, or any mixture.  Originally only uppercase letters were
   allowed, as use of lower case letters involves an  extension  to  the
   FORTRAN-77  standard.  It was found, however, that all computers used
   support lower case letters, so the ability to use lower case  letters
   has been included, for the sake of convenience.
 
        NOTE 3:  Symmetry information is output to  allow  the  user  to
   verify  that  the  requested  symmetry  functions  have  in fact been
   recognized and used.
 
        NOTE 4:  The data for this example  used  a  mixture  of  atomic
   numbers  and  chemical symbols, but the internal coordinate output is
   consistently in chemical symbols.
 
        The atoms in the system are, in order:
 
               Atom 1, an oxygen atom;  this is defined as being at  the
          origin.
 
               Atom 2, the carbon atom.  Defined as being 1.2  Angstroms
          from the oxygen atom, it is located in the +x direction.  This
          distance is marked for optimization.
 
               Atom 3, a hydrogen atom.  It  is  defined  as  being  1.1
          Angstroms  from  the  carbon  atom, and making an angle of 120
          degrees with the oxygen atom.  The asterisks indicate that the
          bond length and angle are both to be optimized.
 
               Atom 4, a hydrogen atom.  The bond  length  supplied  has
          been  overwritten  with  the symmetry-defined C-H bond length.
          Atom 4 is defined as being 1.1 Angstroms from atom 2, making a
          bond-angle of 120 degrees with atom 1, and a dihedral angle of
          180 degrees with atom 3.
 
               None  of  the  coordinates  of  atom  4  are  marked  for
          optimization.   The bond-length and angle are symmetry-defined
          by atom 3, and the dihedral is  group-theory  symmetry-defined
          as being 180 degrees.  (The molecule is flat.)
 
        NOTE 5:  The cartesian coordinates are calculated as follows:
 
               Stage 1:  The coordinate of the first atom is defined  as
          being  at  the origin of cartesian space, while the coordinate
          of the second atom  is  defined  as  being  displaced  by  its
          defined bond length along the positive x-axis.  The coordinate
                                  4-5
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                EXAMPLES
 
 
          of the third atom is defined as being displaced  by  its  bond
          length in the x-y plane, from either atom 1 or 2 as defined in
          the data, or from atom 2 if no numbering is given.  The  angle
          it makes with atoms 1 and 2 is that given by its bond angle.
 
               The dihedral, which first appears in the fourth atom,  is
          defined  according to the I.U.P.A.C.  convention.  NOTE:  This
          is different from previous versions of MNDO and MINDO/3, where
          the dihedral had the opposite chirality to that defined by the
          I.U.P.A.C.  convention.
 
               Stage  2:   Any  dummy  atoms  are  removed.    As   this
          particular system contains no dummy atoms, nothing is done.
 
        NOTE 6:  The interatomic distances are  output  for  the  user's
   advice,  and  a  simple  check  made  to  insure  that  the  smallest
   interatomic distance is greater than 0.8 Angstroms.
 
        NOTE 7:  The geometry is optimized in a series of  cycles,  each
   cycle  consisting  of a line-search and calculation of the gradients.
   The time given is the C.P.U.  time for the cycle;  time left  is  the
   total  time  requested (here 100 seconds) less the C.P.U.  time since
   the start of the calculation (which is earlier than the start of  the
   first cycle!).  These times can vary considerably from cycle to cycle
   due to different options being used, for example whether or  not  the
   density  matrix  is  being updated at every point in the line search.
   The gradient is  the  scalar  length  in  kcal/mole/Angstrom  of  the
   gradient vector.
 
        NOTE 8:  At the  end  of  the  Davidon-Fletcher-Powell  geometry
   optimization  a message is given which indicates how the optimization
   ended.   All  "normal"  termination   messages   contain   the   word
   "satisfied";   other  terminations  may  give acceptable results, but
   more care  should  be  taken,  particularly  regarding  the  gradient
   vector.
 
        NOTE 9 and 10:  The key-words  used,  titles  and  comments  are
   reproduced here to remind the user of the name of the calculation.
 
        NOTE 11 and 12:  Two messages are given here.  The  first  is  a
   reminder  of  how the geometry was obtained, whether from the D.F.P.,
   Bartel's or the McIver-Komornicki methods.  For any  further  results
   to  be  printed  the second message must be as shown;  when no SCF is
   obtained no results will be printed.
 
        NOTE 13:  Again, the results are  headed  with  either  MNDO  or
   MINDO/3 banners, and the version number.
 
        NOTE 14:  The total energy of the system is the addition of  the
   electronic  and  nuclear terms.  The heat of formation is relative to
   the elements in their standard state.  The I.P.  is the  negative  of
   the  energy  level  of  the  highest  occupied,  or highest partially
   occupied molecular orbital (in accordance with Koopman's theorem).
 
 
 
                                  4-6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        NOTE 15:  Advice on time required for the calculation.  This  is
   obviously useful in estimating the times required for other systems.
 
        NOTE 16:  The fully optimized geometry is printed  here.   If  a
   parameter  is  not  marked  for  optimization, it will not be changed
   unless it is a symmetry-related parameter.
 
        NOTE 17:  The roots are the  eigenvalues  or  energy  levels  in
   electron  volts  of  the  molecular  orbitals.   There are six filled
   levels, therefore the HOMO has an energy of -11.041eV, and is  mainly
   lone-pair on oxygen.  The eigenvectors form an orthonormal set.
 
        NOTE 18:  The charge on an atom is the sum of the positive  core
   charge;  for hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen these numbers are 1.0, 4.0,
   and 6.0, respectively, and the negative  of  the  number  of  valence
   electrons, or atom electron density on the atom, here 1.0010, 3.7079,
   and 6.2902 respectively.
 
        NOTE 19:  The dipole is the  scalar  of  the  dipole  vector  in
   cartesian coordinates.  The components of the vector coefficients are
   the  point-charge  dipole   and   the   hybridization   dipole.    In
   formaldehyde there is no z-dipole since the molecule is flat.
 
        NOTE 20:  MNDO AM1, and MINDO/3  all  use  the  Coulson  density
   matrix.   Only  the diagonal elements of the matrix, representing the
   valence orbital electron populations, will  be  printed,  unless  the
   keyword DENSITY is specified.

        NOTE 1:  All three words, ROT, FORCE, and THERMO  are  necessary
   in  order  to  obtain  thermodynamic  properties.  In order to obtain
   results for only one temperature, THERMO has  the  first  and  second
   arguments  identical.  The symmetry number for the C2v point-group is
   2.
 
        NOTE 2:  Internal coordinate derivatives are in Kcal/Angstrom or
   Kcal/radian.  Values of less than about 0.2 are quite acceptable.
 
        NOTE 3:  In larger calculations, the time estimates are  useful.
   In  practice  they  are  pessimistic,  and only about 70% of the time
   estimated will be used, usually.
 
        The principal moments of inertia can be directly related to  the
   microwave spectrum of the molecule.  They are simple functions of the
   geometry of the system, and are  usually  predicted  with  very  high
   accuracy.
 
        NOTE 4:  The trivial vibrations are, in order, translation in x,
   y,  and  z,  and  rotation  in  x,  y,  and  z.   Errors in the force
   calculation appear in Tx, Ty, and Tz, and in the geometry in Rx,  Ry,
   and  Rz.   Ideally, all six should be zero, but values of Tx, Ty, and
   Tz less than about 0.0050, and Rx, Ry, and Rz less than about  0.0080
   are  acceptable.   For  linear  systems  there will only be 5 trivial
   vibrations, and for polymers only 4.  For polymers,  only  the  three
   translations  are considered as trivial;  the single trivial rotation
   is considered in the genuine  force-constants,  and  should  be  very
   small.
 
 
                                  5-7
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        NOTE 5:  These are the "genuine" force  constants:   there  will
   normally be 3N-6 of these.
 
        NOTE 6:  The transition dipoles are useful  in  determining  the
   intensity  of  I.R.   absorption  bands.   The reduced mass indicates
   which  atoms  are  involved  in  a  vibration;   thus,  vibration  10
   principally involves carbon and oxygen.
 
        NOTE 7:  These are the normal  modes  of  vibration.   The  last
   three, five or six are the "trivial" vibrations, and should be small.
 
        NOTE 8:  In order, the thermodynamic quantities calculated are:
 
        (1) The vibrational contribution,
 
        (2) The rotational contribution,
 
        (3)  The  sum  of  (1)  and  (2),  this   gives   the   internal
   contribution,
 
        (4) The translational contribution.
 
        For partition functions the various contributions are multiplied
   together.

   5.3  EXAMPLE OF REACTION PATH WITH SYMMETRY
 
        In this example, one methyl group in ethane is rotated  relative
   to  the  other  and  the geometry is optimized at each point.  As the
   reaction coordinate involves three Hydrogen atoms moving, symmetry is
   imposed to ensure equivalence of all hydrogens.

   6.1  INTRODUCTION
 
        While all the theory used in MOPAC is in the literature, so that
   in  principle  one  to  could read and understand the algorithm, many
   parts of the  code  involve  programming  concepts  or  constructions
   which, while not of sufficient importance to warrant publication, are
   described here in order to facilitate understanding.
 
 
 
   6.2  CONVERGENCE TESTS IN SUBROUTINE ITER
 
   Self-Consistency Test
 
        The SCF iterations are stopped when  two  tests  are  satisfied.
   These  are  (1)  when  the  difference  in  electronic energy, in eV,
   between any two consecutive iterations drops  below  SELCON  and  the
   difference  between  any three consecutive iterations drops below ten
   times SELCON, and (2) the difference in density  matrix  elements  on
   two  successive  iterations  falls  below  a preset limit, which is a
   multiple of SELCON.
 
        SELCON is set initially to 0.00001 kcal/mole;  this can be  made
   100  times  smaller  by  specifying  PRECISE  or  FORCE.   It  can be
   over-ridden  by   explicitly   defining   the   SCF   criterion   via
   SCFCRT=0.0000001.
 
        SELCON is further modified by the value of the gradient norm, if
   known.   If  GNORM  is  large,  then  a  more  lax  SCF  criterion is
   acceptable, and SCFCRT can be relaxed up  to  50  times  its  default
   value.   As the gradient norm drops, the SCF criterion returns to its
   default value.
 
        The SCF test is performed using the energy calculated  from  the
   Fock  matrix  which  arises  from  a density matrix, and not from the
   density matrix which arises from a  Fock.   In  the  limit,  the  two
   energies  would be identical, but the first converges faster than the
   second, without loss of precision.

   6.3  CONVERGENCE IN SCF CALCULATION
 
        A brief  description  of  the  convergence  techniques  used  in
   subroutine ITER follows.
 
        ITER, the SCF calculation, employs  six  methods  to  achieve  a
   self-consistent field.  In order of usage, these are:
 
        (a) Intrinsic convergence by virtue of the way  the  calculation
   is  carried  out.   Thus  a  trial Fock gives rise to a trial density
   matrix, which in turn is used to generate a better Fock matrix.
 
        This is normally convergent, but many exceptions are known.  The
   main situations when the intrinsic convergence does not work are:
 
               (1) A bad starting density matrix.  This normally  occurs
          when  the  default starting density matrix is used.  This is a
          very  crude  approximation,  and  is  only  used  to  get  the
          calculation  started.   A large charge is generated on an atom
          in the first iteration the second  iteration  overcompensates,
          and an oscillation is generated.
 
               (2) The equations are only very slowly convergent.   This
          can  be  due to a long-lived oscillation or to a slow transfer
          of charge.
 
        (b) Oscillation damping.  If, on any two consecutive iterations,
   a  density matrix element changes by more than 0.05, then the density
   matrix element is set equal to the old element shifted by 0.05 in the
   direction  of the calculated element.  Thus, if on iterations 3 and 4
   a certain density matrix element was  0.55  and  0.78,  respectively,
   then  the  element  would be set to 0.60 (=0.55+0.05) on iteration 4.
   The density matrix from  iteration  4  would  then  be  used  in  the
   construction  of the next Fock matrix.  The arrays which hold the old
   density matrices are not filled until after iteration  2.   For  this
   reason they are not used in the damping before iteration 3.
 
        (c) Three-point interpolation of the density matrix.  Subroutine
   CNVG  monitors  the  number  of  iterations,  and  if this is exactly
   divisible by three, and certain  other  conditions  relating  to  the
   density  matrices  are  satisfied,  a  three-point  interpolation  is
   performed.  This is the default converger, and is very effective with
   normally  convergent  calculations.   It  fails  in  certain systems,
   usually those where significant charge buildup is present.
 
        (d) Energy-level shift  technique.   The  virtual  M.O.   energy
   levels  are  shifted to more positive energy.  This has the effect of
   damping oscillations, and intrinsically divergent equations can often
   be changed to intrinsically convergent form.  (Invoked by the keyword
   SHIFT=n.nnnn)
 
        (e) Pulay's method.  If requested, when the  largest  change  in
   density  matrix  elements  on  two consecutive iterations has dropped
   below 0.1, then routine CNVG is abandoned in favour of  a  multi-Fock
   matrix  interpolation.  This relies on the fact that the eigenvectors
   of the density and Fock matrices are identical  at  self-consistency,
                                  6-2
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                               BACKGROUND
 
 
   so  [P.F]=0  at  SCF.   The  extent  to which this condition does not
   obtain is a measure of the deviance from  self-consistency.   Pulay's
   method uses this relationship to calculate that linear combination of
   Fock matrices which minimize [P.F].  This new  Fock  matrix  is  then
   used in the SCF calculation.
 
        Under certain circumstances, Pulay's method can cause very  slow
   convergence,   but  sometimes  it  is  the  only  way  to  achieve  a
   self-consistent field.  At other times the procedure gives a ten-fold
   increase in speed, so care must be exercised in its use.  (invoked by
   the keyword PULAY)
 
        (f) The Camp-King converger.  If all else fails,  the  Camp-King
   converger  is  just about guaranteed to work every time.  However, it
   is very expensive in time, and therefore is invoked as a last resort.
 
        It  evaluates  that  linear  combination  of  old  and   current
   eigenvectors  which  minimize the total energy.  One of its strengths
   is that systems which otherwise oscillate due to charge surges,  e.g.
   CHO-H,  the  C-H  distance being very large, will converge using this
   very sophisticated converger.
 
 
 
   6.4  CAUSES OF FAILURE TO ACHIEVE A SCF
 
        In  a  system  where  a  biradical  can  form,  such  as  ethane
   decomposing  into two CH3 units, the normal RHF procedure can fail to
   go self-consistent.  If the system has marked biradicaloid character,
   then  BIRADICAL or UHF and TRIPLET can often prove successful.  These
   options rely on  the  assumption  that  two  unpaired  electrons  can
   represent the open shell part of the wave-function.
 
        Consider H-Cl, with  the  interatomic  distance  being  steadily
   increased.   At  first  the  covalent  bond  will  be  strong,  and a
   self-consistent field is readily obtained.  Gradually the  bond  will
   become  more ionic, and eventually the charge on chlorine will become
   very   large.    The   hydrogen,   meanwhile,   will   become    very
   electropositive,  and  there will be an increased energy advantage to
   any one electron to transfer from chlorine to hydrogen.  If  this  in
   fact  occurred, the hydrogen would suddenly become very electron-rich
   and would, on the next iteration, lose  its  extra  electron  to  the
   chlorine.   A  sustained  oscillation  would  then  be initiated.  To
   prevent this, if BIRADICAL is specified, exactly  one  electron  will
   end  up  on hydrogen.  A similar result can be obtained by specifying
   TRIPLET in a UHF calculation.
 
 
 
   6.5  TORSION ANGLE COHERENCY
 
        MOPAC calculations do not distinguish between  diasterioisomers;
   consequently,  the  sign of the dihedrals can be multiplied by -1 and
   the calculations  will  be  unaffected.   However,  if  chirality  is
   important, a user should be aware of the sign convention used.
 
                                  6-3
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        The dihedral angle convention used in MOPAC is that  defined  by
   Klyne  and Prelog in Experientia 16, 521 (1960).  In this convention,
   four atoms, AXYB, with a dihedral angle of 90 degrees, will have atom
   B  rotated  by  90  degrees  clockwise relative to A when X and Y are
   lined up in the direction of sight, X being nearer to  the  eye.   In
   their  words,  "To  distinguish  between enantiomeric types the angle
   :tau:  is considered as positive when it is measured  clockwise  from
   the  front substituent A to the rear substituent B, and negative when
   it is measured anticlockwise." The underlined words indicate chirally
   significant  words  and phrases.  The alternative convention was used
   in all earlier programs, including QCPE 355.
 
 
 
   6.6  VIBRATIONAL ANALYSIS
 
        Analyzing  normal  coordinates  is  very  tedious.   Users   are
   normally  familiar  with  the internal coordinates of the system they
   are studying, but not familiar with the  cartesian  coordinates.   To
   help  characterize  the normal coordinates, a very simple analysis is
   done automatically, and users are strongly  encouraged  to  use  this
   analysis   first,   and   then  to  look  at  the  normal  coordinate
   eigenvectors.
 
        In the analysis, each pair of bonded atoms is examined to see if
   there  is  a  large relative motion between them.  By bonded is meant
   within the Van der Waals' distance.  If there is such a  motion,  the
   indices  of  the  atoms,  the relative distance in Angstroms, and the
   percentage radial motion are printed.  Radial plus tangential  motion
   adds  to 100%, but as there are two orthogonal tangential motions and
   only one radial, the radial component is printed.
 
 
 
   6.7  SPARKLES
 
        Four extra "elements" have been put into MOPAC.  These represent
   pure  ionic  charges,  roughly  equivalent  to the following chemical
   entities:
    Chemical Symbol          Equivalent to
 
          +       Tetramethyl ammonium radical, Potassium atom or Cesium atom.
          ++      Barium atom.
          -       Borohydride radical, Halogen, or Nitrate radical
          --      Sulfate, oxalate.
 
 
        For  the  purposes  of  discussion  these  entities  are  called
   "sparkles":  the name arises from consideration of their behavior.

                               BACKGROUND
 
 
        Behavior of sparkles in MOPAC.
                                _____
 
        Sparkles have the following properties:
 
   1.  Their nuclear charge is integer, and is +1, +2, -1, or -2;  there
       are    an    equivalent   number   of   electrons   to   maintain
       electroneutrality, 1, 2, -1, and -2 respectively.
 
   2.  They all have an ionic radius of 0.7 Angstroms.  Any two sparkles
       of  opposite  sign  will  form  an  ion-pair  with  a interatomic
       separation of 1.4A.
 
   3.  They have a  zero  heat  of  atomization,  no  orbitals,  and  no
       ionization potential.
 
 
        They can be regarded as unpolarizable  ions  of  diameter  1.4A.
   They  do  not  contribute  to the orbital count, and cannot accept or
   donate electrons.
 
        Since they appear as uncharged species which immediately ionize,
   attention  should  be  given  to the charge on the whole system.  For
   example, if the alkaline metal salt  of  formic  acid  was  run,  the
   formula would be:
 
        HCOO+ where + is the unipositive sparkle.   The  charge  on  the
   system would then be zero.
 
        A water molecule polarized by a positive sparkle would have  the
   formula H2O+, and the charge on the system would be +1
 
        At first sight, a sparkle would appear to be too ionic to  be  a
   point charge and would combine with the first charge of opposite sign
   it encountered.
 
        This representation is faulty, and a better description would be
   of  an  ion,  of  diameter  1.4A, and the charge delocalized over its
   surface.  Computationally, a sparkle is  an  integer  charge  at  the
   center  of a repulsion sphere of form exp(-alpha*r).  The hardness of
   the sphere is such that other atoms or sparkles can  approach  within
   about  2  Angstroms quite easily, but only with great difficulty come
   closer than 1.4A.
 
        Uses of Sparkles
 
   1.  They can be used as counterions, e.g.  for  acid  anions  or  for
       cations.   Thus, if the ionic form of an acid is wanted, then the
       moieties H.X, H.-, and +.X could be examined.
 
   2.  Two sparkles of equal and opposite sign can  form  a  dipole  for
       mimicking  solvation  effects.  Thus water could be surrounded by
       six dipoles to simulate the solvent cage.  A dipole  of  value  D
       can  be  made  by using the two sparkles + and -, or using ++ and
       --.  If + and - are used, the inter-sparkle separation  would  be
       D/4.803  Angstroms.   If ++ and -- are used, the separation would
       be D/9.606 Angstroms.  If the inter-sparkle  separation  is  less
                                  6-5
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                               BACKGROUND
 
 
       than 1.0 Angstroms (a situation that cannot occur naturally) then
       the energy due to the dipole on its own is  subtracted  from  the
       total energy.
 
   3.  They can operate as polarization functions.  A controlled, shaped
       electric field can easily be made from two or more sparkles.  The
       polarizability in cubic Angstroms of a molecule in any particular
       orientation can then easily be calculated.
 
 
 
 
   6.8  MECHANISM OF THE FRAME IN THE FORCE CALCULATION
 
        The FORCE calculation uses cartesian  coordinates,  and  all  3N
   modes  are  calculated, where N is the number of atoms in the system.
   Clearly, there will be 5 or 6 "trivial" vibrations,  which  represent
   the  three  translations and two or three rotations.  If the molecule
   is exactly at a stationary point, then these "vibrations" will have a
   force  constant  and  frequency  of  precisely  zero.   If  the force
   calculation was done correctly, and the molecule was not exactly at a
   stationary point, then the three translations should be exactly zero,
   but the rotations  would  be  non-zero.   The  extent  to  which  the
   rotations are non-zero is a measure of the error in the geometry.
 
        If the distortions are  non-zero,  the  trivial  vibrations  can
   interact with the low-lying genuine vibrations or rotations, and with
   the transition vibration if present.
 
        To  prevent  this  the  analytic  form  of  the  rotations   and
   vibrations  is calculated, and arbitrary eigenvalues assigned;  these
   are 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, and 1000 millidynes/angstrom for Tx, Ty,
   Tz,  Rx,  Ry  and  Rz  (if present), respectively.  The rotations are
   about the principal axes of  inertia  for  the  system,  taking  into
   account  isotopic  masses.   The  "force  matrix"  for  these trivial
   vibrations is determined,  and  added  on  to  the  calculated  force
   matrix.    After   diagonalization   the  arbitrary  eigenvalues  are
   subtracted off the trivial vibrations, and the resulting numbers  are
   the  "true"  values.   Interference  with  genuine vibrations is thus
   avoided.
 
 
 
   6.9  PSEUDODIAGONALIZATION -SUBROUTINE DIAG
 
        The basis of subroutine DIAG is the  observation  that  accurate
   matrix   diagonalization   of   the  secular  determinant  is  not  a
   prerequisite in the SCF procedure  for  obtaining  a  self-consistent
   density  matrix  in a variationally optimized calculation.  To have a
   self-consistent density matrix it is sufficient to  have  annihilated
   all  energy  matrix  elements  connecting  the  occupied  and virtual
   molecular orbitals.
                                 THEORY
 
 
 
                                  6-6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                               BACKGROUND
 
 
        Given a basis set of N atomic orbitals and Ne  electrons,  there
   will  be  No  =  Ne  /2  occupied  molecular orbitals and Nvir = N-Nv
   virtual orbitals.  If the approximate form of the molecular  orbitals
   is  known,  perhaps from an accurate, standard diagonalization of the
   first trial secular determinant, then the interaction matrix  can  be
   constructed.   The  off-diagonal  matrix  elements in Fov can then be
   annihilated by a series of 2x2 rotations in  the  manner  of  Jacobi.
   Unlike  Jacobi,  however,  the  method  need not be cycled to exactly
   diagonalize Fov;  it is sufficient to have only one sweep.   This  is
   due  to  the  fact  that  the Fock equations form a pseudo-eigenvalue
   problem, and it is necessary to iterate to obtain  a  self-consistent
   field.   For  the  same  reason  the  second-order effects of the 2x2
   rotations  can  be  ignored.   In  an   exact   diagonalization   the
   off-diagonal  matrix elements formed by an elementary 2 by 2 rotation
   would have to be eliminated.  These are normally less than one  tenth
   of  the  matrix  element  being annihilated, and as the SCF procedure
   does not converge at one magnitude per cycle the second-order  errors
   introduced  can  be  absorbed  into  the Fock matrix of the following
   cycle.  Also, since second-order effects in the "diagonalization" are
   being  ignored  it  is  equally  valid to eliminate only those matrix
   elements which are comparable with the largest off-diagonal  elements
   in  Fov.   A further advantage of the pseudo-eigenvalue nature of the
   SCF equations appears when we come to evaluate the diagonal terms  of
   the secular determinant.  For this, we can equate these elements with
   the eigenvalues resulting from the exact  diagonalization,  and  hold
   them  exactly constant throughout the entire calculation, right up to
   self-consistency.  At first sight  this  would  appear  to  introduce
   errors  in  the final SCF density matrix, as obviously the sum of the
   eigenvalues cannot be constant in an exact calculation, and thus  the
   final  sum  of  occupied energy levels must be in error.  However, to
   obtain a SCF density matrix we not only do not need to know the exact
   eigenvalues,  we  have no need to know the sum of the occupied energy
   levels.  Using the initial set of eigenvalues,  a  2  by  2  rotation
   will,  of course, not eliminate fully even those elements which we do
   choose to operate on, but again the pseudoeigenvalue  nature  of  the
   problem  comes to our rescue.  As the iterations proceed those errors
   introduced are rapidly eliminated, so  that  at  self-consistency  an
   exact  density  matrix  is generated, but we have no knowledge of the
   values of the eigenvalues, eigenvectors or two-electron energy.  This
   completes  the  definition of the secular determinant, and the 2 by 2
   rotations needed to pseudo-diagonalize it.  The unitary  matrix  that
   results  from  the  set  of  rotations  would  normally  need  to  be
   multiplied by the original set of eigenvectors to obtain the  correct
   molecular   orbital   matrix.   There  is  no  reason  to  start  the
   pseudo-diagonalization with a unit  matrix,  and  this  step  can  be
   eliminated  by  starting the pseudo-diagonalization using the old set
   of molecular orbitals.

                         COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS
 
        Clearly, an initial exact diagonalization is needed in order  to
   obtain  a good starting set of eigenvectors.  This is, however, not a
   sufficient condition for  initiating  the  use  of  the  new  method.
   During  the  first  one or two cycles of a SCF procedure the order of
   occupancy of  the  molecular  orbitals  may  change.   That  is,  the
   occupancy of the M.O.'s in the first two iterations may correspond to
   an excited singlet state.  For this reason it is recommended that the
   new  method  be used only after the initial large fluctuations in the
   density matrix have died down.  Our arbitrary criterion was that  the
   largest change in the diagonal elements of the density matrix between
   any two iterations should be less than 0.05.
 
        The method proposed  uses  three  matrices:   the  C  matrix  of
   eigenvector  coefficients, the F matrix, and a working matrix to hold
   the new Fov matrix.  In virtual memory computers this would  normally
   not  present  any problem.  A criterion is also needed to decide when
   to perform a 2 by 2 rotation and  elimination.   After  a  few  trial
   calculations,   it  was  found  to  be  efficient  to  eliminate  all
   off-diagonal elements whose modulus was larger than  0.01  times  the
   modulus  of the largest off-diagonal element.  No important change in
   the  number  of  iterations  was  observed.   The  electronic  energy
   calculated  after  each  iteration  does  indeed differ following the
   introduction of the  new  method.   This  is  a  result  of  all  the
   second-order  effects  being  introduced, but the differences between
   electronic energies calculated by the exact  diagonalization  and  by
   the  new  method rapidly converge.  An interesting side-effect of the
   new non-rigorous method is that some damping is introduced:   in  all
   molecules  examined  the  number  of  iterations  required to achieve
   self-consistency either stayed constant or dropped by one or two.

   6.10  DYNAMIC REACTION COORDINATE
 
 
 
 
        Introduction
 
        The  course  of  a  molecular  vibration  can  be  followed   by
   calculating  the  potential and kinetic energy at various times.  Two
   extreme conditions can be identified:  (a) gas phase,  in  which  the
   total  energy  is  a constant through time, there being no damping of
   the kinetic energy allowed, and (b) liquid phase,  in  which  kinetic
   energy  is  always  set  to  zero,  the  motion  of  the  atoms being
   infinitely damped.
 
        All possible degrees of damping are allowed.  In  addition,  the
   facility  exists to dump energy into the system, appearing as kinetic
   energy.  As kinetic energy  is  a  function  of  velocity,  a  vector
   quantity,  the energy appears as energy of motion in the direction in
   which the  molecule  would  naturally  move.   If  the  system  is  a
   transition  state,  then the excess kinetic energy is added after the
   intrinsic kinetic energy has built up to at least 0.2Kcal/mole.
 
        For ground-state systems, the excess energy sometimes may not be
   added;    if   the   intrinsic   kinetic  energy  never  rises  above
   0.2kcal/mole then the excess energy will not be added.
 
 
                             Equations Used
 
                        Force acting on any atom
 
      g(i) + g'(i)t + g"(i)t2 = dE/dx(i) + d2E/dx(i)2 +d3E/dx(i)3
 
             Acceleration due to force acting on each atom
 
                   a(i) = (g(i)+g'(i)t+g"(i)t2)/M(i)
 
                              New velocity
 
        V(o)+Dt*g(i)/M(i)+1/2*Dt**2*g'(i)/M(i)+/3Dt**3g"(i)/M(i)
   or
              V(i) = V(i) + V'(i)t + V''(i)t2 + V'''(i)t3
 
        That is, the change in velocity is equal to  the  integral  over
   the time interval of the acceleration.
 
                         New position of atoms
 
          X(i) = X(o) + V(o)t + 1/2V't2 + 1/3V''t3 + 1/4V'''t4
 
        That is, the change in position is equal to  the  integral  over
   the time interval of the velocity.

                               BACKGROUND
 
 
        The velocity vector is accurate to the extent that it takes into
   account   the   previous  velocity,  the  current  acceleration,  the
   predicted acceleration, and the change in predicted acceleration over
   the  time  interval.   Very  little error is introduced due to higher
   order contributions  to  the  velocity;   those  that  do  occur  are
   absorbed  in  a  re-normalization  of  the  magnitude of the velocity
   vector after each time interval.
 
        The magnitude of Dt, the time interval, is determined mainly  by
   the  factor  needed  to  re-normalize  the velocity vector.  If it is
   significantly different from unity, Dt will be  reduced;   if  it  is
   very close to unity, Dt will be increased.
 
        Even with all this, errors creep in and a system, started at the
   transition  state,  is unlikely to return precisely to the transition
   state unless an  excess  kinetic  energy  is  supplied,  for  example
   0.2Kcal/mole.
 
        The calculation is carried out  in  cartesian  coordinates,  and
   converted  into  internal  coordinates  for  display.   All cartesian
   coordinates must be allowed to vary, in order to conserve angular and
   translational momentum.
 
 
 
   6.11  CONFIGURATION INTERACTION
 
        MOPAC  contains  a  very  large   Multi-Electron   Configuration
   Interaction  calculation, MECI, which allows almost any configuration
   interaction calculation to be performed.  Because of its  complexity,
   two  distinct levels of input are supported;  the default values will
   be of use to the novice while an expert has available  an  exhaustive
   set of key-words from which a specific C.I.  can be tailored.
 
        A MECI  calculation  involves  the  interaction  of  microstates
   representing  specific  permutations  of electrons in a set of M.O.s.
   Starting with a set electronic configuration, either closed shell  or
   open  shell,  but  unconditionally restricted Hartree-Fock, the first
   step in a MECI calculation is the  removal  from  the  M.O.s  of  the
   electrons to be used in the C.I.
 
        Each microstate is then constructed from these  empty  M.O.s  by
   adding  in  electrons according to a prescription.  The energy of the
   configuration is evaluated, as is the energy of interaction with  all
   previously-defined  configurations.   Diagonalization then results in
   state functions.  From the eigenvectors the expectation value  of  s2
   is calculated, and the spin-states of the state functions calculated.

                               BACKGROUND
 
 
                     General Overview of Key-Words
 
        Key-words associated with the operations of MECI are:
     SINGLET                DOUBLET               EXCITED
     TRIPLET                QUARTET               BIRADICAL
     QUINTET                SEXTET                ESR
     OPEN(n1,n2)            C.I.=n                MECI
     SIZE=n                 ROOT=n
 
 
        Each  key-word  may  imply  others;   thus  TRIPLET  implies  an
   open-shell  system,  therefore  OPEN(2,2),  SIZE=2,  and  C.I.=1  are
   implied, if not user specified.
 
 
 
                   Starting Electronic Configuration
 
        MECI is restricted to RHF calculations,  but  with  that  single
   restriction  any  starting configuration will be supported.  Examples
   of starting configurations would be
    System               Key-Words used       Starting Configuration
 
   Methane                 <none>             2.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 2.00
   Methyl Radical          <none>             2.00 2.00 2.00 2.00 1.00
   Twisted Ethylene        TRIPLET            2.00 2.00 2.00 1.00 1.00
   Twisted Ethylene        OPEN(2,2)          2.00 2.00 2.00 1.00 1.00
   Twisted Ethylene Cation OPEN(1,2)          2.00 2.00 2.00 0.50 0.50
   Methane Cation          CHARGE=1 OPEN(5,3) 2.00 2.00 1.67 1.67 1.67
 
 
        Choice of starting configuration is important.  For example,  if
   twisted  ethylene,  a  ground-state  triplet,  is  not  defined using
   TRIPLET or OPEN(2,2), then the  closed-shell  ground-state  structure
   will  be  calculated.   Obviously  this configuration is a legitimate
   microstate, but from the symmetry of the system a better choice would
   be  to  define  one  electron  in each of the two formally degenerate
   pi-type M.O.s.  The initial  SCF  calculation  does  not  distinguish
   between  OPEN(2,2)  and  TRIPLET since both key-words define the same
   starting configuration.  This  can  be  verified  by  monitoring  the
   convergance  using  PL,  for  which  both key-words give the same SCF
   energy.
 
 
 
            Removal of Electrons from Starting Configuration
 
        For a starting configuration of alpha  M.O.   occupancies  O(i),
   O(i)  being  in  the  range  0.0  to  1.0,  the energies of the M.O.s
   involved in the MECI can be calculated from
 
                     E(i) = Sum(j)(2J(i,j)-K(i,j))O(j)
 
 
   where J(i,j) and  K(i,j)  are  the  coulomb  and  exchange  integrals
   between  M.O.s  i  and  j.   The  M.O.  index j runs over those M.O.s
                                  6-11
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                               BACKGROUND
 
 
   involved in the MECI  only.   Most  MECI  calculations  will  involve
   between  1  and  5  M.O.s, so a system with about 30 filled or partly
   filled  M.O.s  could  have  M.O.s  25-30  involved.   The   resulting
   eigenvalues correspond to those of the cationic system resulting from
   removal of n electrons, where n is  twice  the  sum  of  the  orbital
   occupancies of those M.O.s involved in the C.I.
 
        The arbitary zero  of  energy  in  a  MECI  calculation  is  the
   starting  ground  state, without any correction for errors introduced
   by the use of fractional occupancies.   In  order  to  calculate  the
   energy  of the various configurations, the energy of the vacuum state
   (i.e., the state resulting from removal of the electrons used in  the
   C.I.) needs to be evaluated.  This energy is defined by
 
 
         GSE = Sum(i)[ E(i)O(i) + J(i,i) * O(i)*O(i)
             + Sum(j<i){ 2(2J(i,j) - K(i,j) ) * O(i)*O(j) } ]
 
 
 
 
                 Formation of Microstate Configuration
 
        Microstates are particular  electron  configurations.   Thus  if
   there  are 5 electrons in 5 levels, then various microstates could be
   as follows:
 
 
                 Microstates for 5 electrons in 5 M.O.s
 
           Electron Configuration               Electron Configuration
 
             Alpha       Beta       M(s)          Alpha       Beta        M(s)
           1 2 3 4 5  1 2 3 4 5                 1 2 3 4 5  1 2 3 4 5
 
     1     1,1,1,0,0  1,1,0,0,0    1/2      4    1,1,1,1,1  0,0,0,0,0     5/2
     2     1,1,0,0,0  1,1,1,0,0   -1/2      5    1,1,0,1,0  1,1,0,0,0     1/2
     3     1,1,1,0,0  0,0,0,1,1    1/2      6    1,1,0,1,0  1,0,1,0,0     1/2
 
 
 
        For  5  electrons  in  5  M.O.s  there   are   252   microstates
   (10!/(5!5!)),  but as states of different spin do not mix, we can use
   a smaller number.  If doublet  states  are  needed  then  100  states
   (5!/(2!3!)(5!/3!2!)  are  needed.   If  only  quartet  states  are of
   interest then 25 states (5!/(1!4!)(5!/4!1!) are  needed  and  if  the
   sextet state is required, then only one state is calculated.
 
        In  the  microstates  listed,  state  1  is   the   ground-state
   configuration.   This  can  be  written  as (2,2,1,0,0), meaning that
   M.O.s 1 and 2 are doubly occupied, M.O.  3 is singly occupied  by  an
   alpha  electron,  and  M.O.s  4  and 5 are empty.  Microstate 1 has a
   component of spin of  1/2,  and  is  a  pure  doublet.   By  Kramer's
   degeneracy  - sometimes called time-inversion symmetry - microstate 2
   is also a doublet, and has a spin of 1/2 and a component of  spin  of
   -1/2.
                                  6-12
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        Microstate 3, while it has a component of spin of 1/2, is not  a
   doublet,  but  is  in  fact a component of a doublet, a quartet and a
   sextet.  The coefficients of these states can be calculated from  the
   Clebsch-Gordon  3-J  symbol.   For  example,  the  coefficient in the
   sextet is 1/Sqrt(5).
 
        Microstate 4 is a  pure  sextet.   If  all  100  microstates  of
   component  of  spin  =  1/2 were used in a C.I., one of the resulting
   states would have  the  same  energy  as  the  state  resulting  from
   microstate 4.
 
        Microstate 5 is an excited  doublet,  and  microstate  6  is  an
   excited state of the system, but not a pure spin-state.
 
        By default, if n M.O.s  are  included  in  the  MECI,  then  all
   possible  microstates  which give rise to a component of spin = 0 for
   even electron systems, or 1/2 for odd electron systems, will be used.

                Multi Electron Configuration Interaction
 
 
 
 
        The numbering of the M.O.s used in the  MECI  is  standard,  and
   follows  the  Aufbau  principle.  The order of filling is in order of
   energy, and alpha before beta.  This point is critically important in
   deciding  the  sign  of matrix elements.  For a 5 M.O.  system, then,
   the order of filling is.
             _     _     _     _     _
         (1)(1)(2)(2)(3)(3)(4)(4)(5)(5)
 
 
        A triplet state  arising  from  two  microstates,  each  with  a
   component of spin = 0, will thus be the positive combination.
         _                _
        (1)(2)   +    (1)(2)
 
 
        This is in variance with the sign  convention  used  in  earlier
   programs  for running MNDO.  This standard sign convention was chosen
   in order to allow the signs of the microstate coefficients to conform
   to those resulting from the spin step-down operator.
 
        Matrix elements between all pairs of microstates are  calculated
   in  order  to  form  the  secular determinant.  Many elements will be
   identically zero, due to the interacting  determinants  differing  by
   more  than  two  M.O.s.  For the remaining interactions the following
   types can be identified.
 
   1.  The two determinants are identical:
 
            No permutations are necessary in order to calculate the sign
       of the matrix element.  E(p,p) is given simply by
 
       E(p,p)=Sum(i)Oa(i,p)*[Eig(i) + Sum(1/2(<ii|jj>-<ij|ij>)*Oa(j,p)
                               +              <ii|jj>         *Ob(j,p))
            + Sum(i)Ob(i,p)*[Eig(i) + Sum(1/2(<ii|jj>-<ij|ij>)*Ob(j,p))
 
 
               Oa(i,p) = Occupancy of alpha M.O. i in Microstate p
               Ob(i,p) = Occupancy of beta M.O. i in Microstate p
 
 
   2.  Determinants differing by exactly one M.O.:
 
            The differing M.O.  can be of type alpha  or  beta.   It  is
       sufficient  to evaluate the case in which both M.O.s are of alpha
       type, the beta form is obtained in like manner.
 
         E(p,q) = Sum(k) [ <ij|kk> - <ik|jk> ) * (Occa(k) - Occg(k))
                         + <ij|kk>             * (Occb(k) - Occg(k)]
 
         E(p,q) may need to be multiplied by -1, if the number of
         two electron permutations required to bring M.O.s i and j
                                  6-14
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
         into coincidence is odd.
 
 
            Where Occa(k) is the alpha molecular  orbital  occupancy  in
       the configuration interaction.
 
   3.  Determinants differing by exactly two M.O.s:
 
            The two M.O.s can have the same or  opposite  spins.   Three
       cases can be identified:
 
       1.  Both M.O.s have alpha spin:
 
                For the first microstate having M.O.s i and j,  and  the
           second  microstate  having  M.O.s k and l, the matrix element

   without any other modifying key-words, the following states  will  be

        These numbers of spin states will be  obtained  irrespective  of
   the chemical nature of the system.
 
 
                       Calculation of Spin-States
 
 
 
 
        In order to calculate the spin-state, the expectation  value  of
   S2 is calculated.
   S2 = S(S+1) = Sz**2 + 2*S(+)S(-)
 
    = Ne -
      Sum(i) [C(i,k)*C(i,k)*{1/4*(Na(i)-Nb(i))**2
    + Sum(l) Oa(l,i)*Ob(l,i)}
     +Sum(j) 2[C(i,k)*C(j,k)*(Kronekerdelta(C(i,k)( S(+)S(-) )C(j,k)]]
 
    Where  Ne      = No. of electrons in C.I.
           C(i,k)  = Coefficient of Microstate i in State k
           Na(i)   = Number of alpha electrons in Microstate i
           Nb(i)   = Number of beta electrons in Microstate i
           Oa(l,k) = Occupancy of alpha M.O. l in Microstate k
           Ob(l,k) = Occupancy of beta M.O. l in Microstate k
           S(+)    = Spin shift up or step up operator
           S(-)    = Spin shift down or step down operator
           The Kronekerdelta is 1 if the two terms in brackets following it
           are identical.
 
 
 
        The spin state is calculated from S = 1/2 ( Sqrt(1+4S2) - 1 )
 
        In practice, S is calculated to  be  exactly  integer,  or  half
   integer.  That is, there is insignificant error due to approximations
   used.  This does not mean, however, that the method is accurate.  The
   spin calculation is completely precise, in the group theoretic sense,
   but the accuracy of the calculation is  limited  by  the  Hamiltonian

   used, a space-dependent function.
 
 
                    Choice of State to be Optimized
 
        MECI can calculate a large number of  states  of  various  total
   spin.   Two  schemes  are  provided  to  allow  a  given  state to be
   selected.  First, ROOT=n will, when used on its own, select the  n'th
   state, irrespective of its total spin.  By default n=1.  If ROOT=n is
   used in conjunction with a key-word from the  set  SINGLET,  DOUBLET,
   TRIPLET,  QUARTET,  QUINTET,  or  SEXTET,  then the n'th root of that
   spin-state will be used.  For example, ROOT=4 and SINGLET will select
   the  4th  singlet  state.   If there are two triplet states below the
   fourth singlet state then this will mean that the sixth state will be
   selected.
 
 
 
                  Calculation of Unpaired Spin Density
 
        Starting with the state  functions  as  linear  combinations  of
   configurations, the unpaired spin density, corresponding to the alpha
   spin density minus the beta spin density, will be calculated for  the
   first  few  states.  This calculation is straightforward for diagonal
   terms, and only those terms are used.

   6.12  REDUCED MASSES IN A FORCE CALCULATION
 
        Reduced masses for a diatomic are given by
                      (mass1) * (mass2)
                      _________________
                      (mass1) + (mass2)
 
        For a Hydrogen molecule the  reduced  mass  is  thus  0.5;   for
   heavily  hydrogenated systems, e.g.  methane, the reduced mass can be
   very low.  A vibration involving only heavy atoms , e.g.   a  C-N  in
   cyanide, should give a large reduced mass.
 
        For the "trivial" vibrations the reduced  mass  is  ill-defined,
   and where this happens the reduced mass is set to zero.

        Details of the mathematics of SADDLE appeared in print in  1984,
   so only a superficial description will be given here.
 
        The main steps in the saddle calculation are as follows:
 
   1.  The heats of formation of both systems are calculated.
 
   2.  A vector R of length 3N-6 defining the difference between the two
       geometries is calculated.
 
 
                                  6-18
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                               BACKGROUND
 
 
   3.  The scalar  P  of  the  difference  vector  is  reduced  by  some
       fraction, normally about 5 to 15 percent.
 
   4.  Identify the geometry of lower energy;  call this G.
 
   5.  Optimize G,  subject  to  the  constraint  that  it  maintains  a
       constant distance P from the other geometry.
 
   6.  If the newly-optimized geometry is  higher  in  energy  then  the
       other  geometry, then go to 1.  If it is higher, and the last two
       steps involved the same geometry moving, make the other  geometry
       G without modifying P, and go to 5.
 
   7.  Otherwise go back to 2.
 
 
        The mechanism of  5  involves  the  coordinates  of  the  moving
   geometry  being  perturbed  by  an amount equal to the product of the
   discrepancy between the calculated and required P and the vector R.
 
        As the specification of the geometries is  quite  difficult,  in
   that the difference vector depends on angles (which are, of necessity
   ill-defined by 360 degrees) SADDLE can be made to  run  in  cartesian
   coordinates  using  the  key-word XYZ.  If this option is chosen then
   the initial steps of the calculation are as follows:
 
   1.  Both geometries are converted into cartesian coordinates.
 
   2.  Both geometries are centered about the origin of cartesian space.
 
   3.  One geometry is rotated until the difference vector is a  minimum
       - this minimum is within 1 degree of the absolute bottom.
 
   4.  The SADDLE calculation then proceeds as described above.
 
   LIMITATIONS:
 
        The two geometries must be related by a  continuous  deformation
   of  the  coordinates.   By  default, internal coordinates are used in
   specifying geometries, and while bond lengths  and  bond  angles  are
   unambiguously  defined (being both positive), the dihedral angles can
   be positive or negative.  Clearly 300 degrees could equally  well  be
   specified as -60 degrees.  A wrong choice of dihedral would mean that
   instead of the desired  reaction  vector  being  used,  a  completely
   incorrect vector was used, with disastrous results.
 
        To correct this, ensure that one geometry can be  obtained  from
   the other by a continuous deformation, or use the XYZ option.

   6.14  POLARIZABILITY CALCULATION
 
        If the electrons in a molecule are easily moved as the result of
   a  stimulus,  then  the  molecule is easily polarizable.  Thus, if an
   applied  electric  field  can  easily  induce  a  dipole,  then   the
   polarizability is large.  Any induced dipole will lower the energy of
   the system, but this stabilization might be masked by the presence of
   a  permanent  dipole.   To  avoid this, use is made of an alternating
   electric field.  If the molecule has an intrinsic  dipole,  then  the
   molecule  will  be  stabilized  in  one direction.  When the field is
   reversed, the molecule will be destabilized, but,  on  averaging  the
   two  effects,  the  result  is  a  net  stabilization due only to the
   induced dipole.
 
        MOPAC calculates the polarizability of molecules, radicals,  and
   ions by use of a shaped electric field.
 
        The applied electric field  is  produced  by  adding  individual
   fields,  each  generated  by  four  point  charges.  Consider first a
   single electric field  in  the  x-direction.   There  are  two  point
   charges  of  value  +Q  and  -Q/2 electrons, at locations l and al, a
   being the cube root of  1/2.   At  the  origin,  the  electric  field
   gradient in volts per metre due to the charges is as follows.
 
            Due to +Q charge:              -QC/(l*l)
 
            Due to -Q/2 charge:             (Q/2)*C/(a*l*a*l)
 
            Therefore total field:       C*Q*(1-1/2**(1/3)) / (l*l).
 
            (C has the value 1.6029*10**(-19) Coulombs)
 
 
        The slope of the total gradient (that is, the  addition  of  the
   two gradients) will be zero.
    Differentiating -C*Q/(l*l) + (Q/2)*C/(a*l*a*l) with respect to x gives
 
                    +C*Q/(2*l*l*l) - (Q/2)*C/(2*a*l*a*l*a*l)
 
                  = +(Q/2)*C/(l*l*l) - (Q/2)*C/(l*l*l) = 0.
 
        In like manner, it can be shown that in the plane  perpendicular
   to  the line joining the point charges, the derivative of the voltage
   gradient is also exactly zero.
 
        A molecule positioned near to the origin will thus experience  a
   uniform  electric field gradient due to these two point charges.  The
   other two point charges are of value +(Q/2) and -Q at points -al  and
   -l,  respectively.   They  produce  an electric field gradient at the
   origin identical to the first two point charges.  The total field, E,
   midway between the two sets of charges is therefore
 
               E =  C*Q*2(1-1/2**(-1/3))/(l*l*4*pi*E(o)),
 
      the 4*pi*E(o) allows for vacuum permittivity.
 
                                  6-20
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
        The heat of formation of the molecule  in  this  field  is  then
   calculated.  This quantity can be expressed as a series sum.
 
   Heat = H.o.F + V*E(Charge) + dV/dx*E(Dipole)
 
                + d2V/dx2*E(polarizability)
 
 
        That is, the heat of formation in the field is the  sum  of  the
   basic  heat  of  formation,  plus  the  electric  potential times any
   charge, any  dipole  times  the  electric  field  gradient,  and  any
   polarizability times the square of the electric field gradient.
 
        We are interested in the polarizability, P.
 
                  P = (2/23.061)*d**2H/dE**2
 
 
      The second derivitive of H with respect to E is given by
 
             d**2H/dE**2 = (H(E)+H(-E)-2*H(0))/(2*E),
 
      H(E) being the heat of formation in the electric field.
 
        The  polarizability  volume,  Vol,  is   calculated   from   the
   polarizability by
 
    Vol=P/(E*4*pi*E(o)) = 2/(E*23.061*4*pi*E(o)) * d**2H/dE**2
 
    Substituting for E we have
 
    Vol=2*l**4*pi*E(o)/(23.061*Q*Q*C*C*(1-1/2**(-1/3))**2) * d**2H/dE**2.
 
   It is a simple matter to  evaluate  the  value  of  this  second-rank
   tensor  by calculating the heats of formation of the molecule subject
   to four different electric field gradients.  For the tensor component
   V(i,j),  i=x  or  y  or  z, j=x or y or z, the directions of the four
   different fields are defined by.
 
      Field 1     +i, +j            Field 2    +i, -j
      Field 2     -i, -j            Field 4    -i, +j.
 
        Thus if i=x and j=x the four fields are
 
       Field 1    +x
       Field 2     0
       Field 3    -x
       Field 4     0
 
        Using  these  four  heats  of  formation,  in   Kcal/mole,   the
   polarizability can be calculated in units of cubic angstroms via

        Monopolar and dipolar terms are eliminated in this treatment.
 
        Finally, monatomic additive terms  are  included  when  MNDO  is
   used.
 
        A  polarization  matrix  of  size  3  *  3  is  constructed  and
   diagonalized,  and  the  resulting  eigenvalues  are  the  calculated
   independent polarization volumes in cubic Angstroms;  the vectors are
   the independent polarization vectors.
 
 
 
   6.15  SOLID STATE CAPABILITY
 
        Currently MOPAC can only handle up to  one-dimensional  extended
   systems,  but  work  is  under  way  to  extend  it  to two and three
   dimensions.  As the solid-state method used is unusual,  details  are
   given at this point.
 
        If a polymer unit cell is large enough, then a single  point  in
   k-space,  the  Gamma  point,  is  sufficient  to  specify  the entire
   Brillouin zone.  The  secular  determinant  for  this  point  can  be
   constructed  by  adding together the Fock matrix for the central unit
   cell plus those for the adjacent unit  cells.   The  Born-von  Karman
   cyclic  boundary conditions are satisfied, and diagonalization yields
   the correct density matrix for the Gamma point.
 
        At this point in the calculation,  conventionally,  the  density
   matrix  for  each unit cell is constructed.  Instead, the Gamma-point
   density  and  one-electron  density  matrices  are  combined  with  a
   "Gamma-point-like" Coulomb and exchange integral strings to produce a
   new Fock matrix.  The calculation can be  visualised  as  being  done
   entirely in reciprical space, at the Gamma point.
 
        Most solid-state calculations take  a  very  long  time.   These
   calculations,   called  "Cluster"  calculations  after  the  original

   calculation.
 
        A minor "fudge" is necessary to  make  this  method  work.   The
   contribution  to  the  Fock  matrix element arising from the exchange
   integral between an atomic orbital and its equivalent in the adjacent
   unit  cells  is  ignored.   This is necessitated by the fact that the
   density matrix element involved is invariably large.
 
        The unit cell must be large enough that an atomic orbital in the
   center  of the unit call has an insignificant overlap with the atomic
   orbitals at the ends of the unit cell.  In  practice,  a  translation
   vector  of  more  that about 7 or 8 Angstroms is sufficient.  For one
   rare group of  compounds  a  larger  translation  vector  is  needed.
   Polymers  with  delocalized  pi-systems, and polymers with very small
   band-gaps will require a  larger  translation  vector,  in  order  to
   accurately  sample  k-space.  For these systems, a translation vector
   in the order of 15-20 Angstroms is needed.

        The  logic  within  MOPAC  is  best   understood   by   use   of
   flow-diagrams.
 
        There are two main sequences, geometric and  electronic.   These
   join   only  at  one  common  subroutine  COMPFG.   It  is  possible,
   therefore, to understand the  geometric  or  electronic  sections  in
   isolation, without having studied the other section.

                                PROGRAM
 
 
   7.3  CONTROL WITHIN MOPAC
 
        Almost all the control information  is  passed  via  the  single
   datum  "KEYWRD",  a  string of 80 characters, which is read in at the
   start of the job.
 
        Each subroutine is made independent, as far as possible, even at
   the expense of extra code or calculation.  Thus, for example, the SCF
   criterion is set in subroutine ITER,  and  nowhere  else.   Similarly
   subroutine  DERIV  has  exclusive  control  of  the  step size in the
   finite-difference calculation of  the  energy  derivatives.   If  the
   default  values  are  to  be reset, then the new value is supplied in
   KEYWRD, and extracted via INDEX and READA.  The flow  of  control  is
   decided by the presence of various key-words in KEYWRD.
 
        When a subroutine is called, it assumes that all  data  required
   for its operation are available in either common blocks or arguments.
   Normally no check is made as to the validity of  the  data  received.
   All  data are "owned" by one, and only one, subroutine.  By ownership
   is implied the permission and  ability  to  change  the  data.   Thus
   MOLDAT  "owns"  the  number of atomic orbitals, in that it calculates
   this number, and stores it in the variable NORBS.   Many  subroutines
   use  NORBS,  but  none  of them is allowed to change it.  For obvious
   reasons no exceptions should be made to this rule.  To illustrate the
   usefulness  of  this  convention,  consider  the  eigenvectors, C and
   CBETA.  These are owned by ITER.  Before ITER is called, C and  CBETA
   are not calculated, after ITER has been called C and CBETA are known,
   so any subroutine which needs to use the eigenvectors can  do  so  in
   the certain knowledge that they exist.
 
        Any variables which are only used within a  subroutine  are  not
   passed  outside  the  subroutine  unless an overriding reason exists.
   This is found in PULAY and CNVG, among others where  arrays  used  to
   hold  spin-dependent  data are used, and these cannot conveniently be
   defined within the subroutines.   In  these  examples,  the  relevant
   arrays are "owned" by ITER.
 
        A general subroutine, of which ITER is a good  example,  handles
   three  kinds  of  data:  First, data which the subroutine is going to
   work on, for example the one and two electron matrices;  second, data
   necessary  to manipulate the first set of data, such as the number of
   atomic  orbitals;   third,  the  calculated  quantities,   here   the
   electronic energy, and the density and Fock matrices.
 
        Reference data are entered into  a  subroutine  by  way  of  the
   common blocks.  This is to emphasize their peripheral role.  Thus the
   number of orbitals, while essential to ITER, is not  central  to  the
   task it has to perform, and is passed through a common block.
 
        Data the subroutine is going to  work  on  are  passed  via  the
   argument list.  Thus the one and two electron matrices, which are the
   main reason for ITER's existence, are entered  as  two  of  the  four
   arguments.   As  ITER does not own these matrices it can use them but
   may not change their contents.   The  other  arguments  are  EE,  the
   electronic  energy,  and FULSCF, a logical.  EE is owned by ITER even
   though it first appears before ITER is called.  FULSCF, on the  other
                                  7-4
 
 
 
 
   hand, is not owned by ITER, and is used, but not changed.
 
        Sometimes common block data should more correctly appear  in  an
   argument  list.   This  is  usually  not  done  in  order  to prevent
   obscuring the main role the subroutine has  to  perform.   Thus  ITER
   calculates   the  density  and  Fock  matrices,  but  these  are  not
   represented in the argument list  as  the  calling  subroutine  never
   needs to know them;  instead, they are stored in common.
 
        SUBROUTINE GMETRY:  Description for programmers.
 
        GMETRY has two arguments, GEO and COORD.  On input GEO  contains
   either  (a)  internal  coordinates  or (b) cartesian coordinates.  On
   exit COORD contains the cartesian coordinates.
 
        The normal mode of usage is to supply the internal  coordinates,
   in  which  case  the connectivity relations are found in common block
   GEOKST.
 
        If the contents of NA(1) is zero, as  required  for  any  normal
   system,  then  the normal internal to cartesian conversion is carried
   out.
 
        If the contents of NA(1) is 99, then the  coordinates  found  in
   GEO  are assumed to be cartesian, and no conversion is made.  This is
   the situation in a FORCE calculation.
 
        A  further  option  exists  within  the  internal  to  cartesian
   conversion.   If  STEP,  stored  in common block REACTN, is non-zero,
   then a reaction path is assumed, and  the  internal  coordinates  are
   adjusted radially in order that the "distance" in internal coordinate
   space from the geometry specified in  GEO  is  STEPP  away  from  the
   geometry stored in GEOA, stored in REACTN.
 
        During the internal to cartesian conversion, the  angle  between
   the  three  atoms used in defining a fourth atom is checked to ensure
   that it is not near to 0 or 180 degrees,  if  it  is  near  to  these
   angles,  then there is a high probability that a faulty geometry will
   be generated and to prevent this the calculation is  stopped  and  an
   error message printed.
 
        NOTE 1:  If the angle is exactly 0  or  180  degrees,  then  the
   calculation  is  not  terminated:   This is the normal situation in a
   high-symmetry molecule such as propyne.
 
        NOTE 2:  The check is only made if the fourth atom  has  a  bond
   angle which is not zero or 180 degrees.

                    ERROR MESSAGES PRODUCED BY MOPAC
 
 
 
        MOPAC produces  several  hundred  messages,  all  of  which  are
   intended to be self-explanatory.  However, when an error occurs it is
   useful to have  more  information  than  is  given  in  the  standard
   messages.
 
        The following alphabetical list gives more complete  definitions
   of the messages printed.
 
                AN UNOPTIMIZABLE GEOMETRIC PARAMETER....
 
        When internal coordinates are supplied, six  coordinates  cannot
   be  optimized.   These are the three coordinates of atom 1, the angle
   and dihedral on atom 2 and the dihedral on atom 3.   An  attempt  has
   been  made to optimize one of these.  This is usually indicative of a
   typographic error, but might simply be an oversight.  Either way, the
   error will be corrected and the calculation will not be stopped here.
 
                      ATOM NUMBER nn IS ILLDEFINED
 
        The rules for definition of atom connectivity are:
 
   1.  Atom 2 must be connected to atom 1 (default - no override)
 
   2.  Atom 3 must be connected to atom 1 or 2, and make an angle with 2
       or 1.
 
   3.  All other atoms must  be  defined  in  terms  of  already-defined
       atoms:   these atoms must all be different.  Thus atom 9 might be
       connected to atom 5, make an  angle  with  atom  6,  and  have  a
       dihedral  with atom 7.  If the dihedral was with atom 5, then the
       geometry definition would be faulty.
 
 
        If any of these rules  is  broken,  a  fatal  error  message  is
   printed, and the calculation stopped.
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                  8-1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                 ATOMIC NUMBER nn IS NOT AVAILABLE ...
 
        An element has been used for which parameters are not available.
   Only  if  a  typographic  error  has been made can this be rectified.
   This check is not exhaustive,  in  that  even  if  the  elements  are
   acceptable  there  are  some  combinations of elements within MINDO/3
   that are not allowed.  This is a fatal error message.
 
                         ATOMIC NUMBER OF nn ?
 
        An atom has been  specified  with  a  negative  or  zero  atomic
   number.   This  is normally caused by forgetting to specify an atomic
   number or symbol.  This is a fatal error message.
 
          ATOMS  nn AND nn ARE SEPARATED BY nn.nnnn ANGSTROMS.
 
        Two genuine atoms (not dummies) are separated by  a  very  small
   distance.   This  can  occur  when  a  complicated  geometry is being
   optimized, in which case the user may wish to continue.  This can  be
   done by using the key-word GEO-OK.  More often, however, this message
   indicates a mistake, and the calculation is, by default, stopped.
 
               ATTEMPT TO GO DOWNHILL IS UNSUCCESSFUL...
 
        A  quite  rare  message,  produced  by  Bartel's  gradient  norm
   minimization.  Bartel's method attempts to minimize the gradient norm
   by searching the gradient space for a minimum.  Apparently a  minimum
   has been found, but not recognized as such.  The program has searched
   in all (3N-6) directions, and found no way down, but the criteria for
   a  minimum  have  not  been  satisfied.   No  advice is available for
   getting round this error.
 
                  BOTH SYSTEMS ARE ON THE SAME SIDE..
 
        A non-fatal message, but still  cause  for  concern.   During  a
   SADDLE  calculation the two geometries involved are on opposite sides
   of the transition state.  This situation is verified at  every  point
   by  calculating  the  cosine  of  the  angle between the two gradient
   vectors.  For as long as it is negative, then the two geometries  are
   on  opposite  sides  of  the  T/S.   If,  however, the cosine becomes
   positive, then the assumption is made that one moiety has fallen over
   the  T/S  and  is  now  below the other geometry.  That is, it is now
   further from the T/S than the other, temporarily fixed, geometry.

                        C.I. NOT ALLOWED WITH UHF
 
        There is no UHF configuration interaction calculation in  MOPAC.
   Either remove the key-word that implies C.I.  or the word UHF.
 
                  CALCULATION ABANDONED AT THIS POINT
 
        A particularly annoying message!  In order to define  an  atom's
   position,  the  three  atoms  used in the connectivity table must not
   accidentally fall into a straight line.  This  can  happen  during  a
   geometry  optimization  or gradient minimization.  If they do, and if
   the angle made by the atom being defined is not zero or 180  degrees,
   then  its  position  becomes ill-defined.  This is not desirable, and
   the calculation will stop in order to allow corrective action  to  be
   taken.  Note that if the three atoms are in an exactly straight line,
   then this message will not be triggered.
 
           CARTESIAN COORDINATES READ IN, AND CALCULATION...
 
        If cartesian coordinates are read in, but the calculation is  to
   be  carried  out using internal coordinates, then either all possible
   geometric variables must be optimized, or none can be optimized.   If
   only  some  are  marked  for optimization then ambiguity exists.  For
   example, if the "X" coordinate of atom 6 is marked for  optimization,
   but  the "Y" is not, then when the conversion to internal coordinates
   takes place, the first coordinate  becomes  a  bond-length,  and  the
   second  an  angle.   These  bear  no  relationship  to the "X" or "Y"
   coordinates.  This is a fatal error.
 
             CARTESIAN COORDINATES READ IN, AND SYMMETRY...
 
        If cartesian coordinates are read in, but the calculation is  to
   be   carried  out  using  internal  coordinates,  then  any  symmetry
   relationships between the cartesian coordinates will not be reflected
   in  the internal coordinates.  For example, if the "Y" coordinates of
   atoms 5 and 6 are  equal,  it  does  not  follow  that  the  internal
   coordinate angles these atoms make are equal.  This is a fatal error.

        Not a fatal error.  The McIver-Komornicki gradient  minimization
   involves  use  of  a  line-search  to find the lowest gradient.  This
   message is merely advice.  However,  if  SIGMA  takes  a  long  time,
   consider  doing  something else, such as using NLLSQ, or refining the
   geometry a bit before resubmitting it to SIGMA.
 
            <<<<----**** FAILED TO ACHIEVE SCF. ****---->>>>
 
        The SCF calculation failed to go to completion;  an unwanted and
   depressing message that unfortunately appears every so often.
 
        To date three unconditional  convergers  have  appeared  in  the
   literature:   the  SHIFT technique, Pulay's method, and the Camp-King
   converger.  It would not be fair to  the  authors  to  condemn  their
   methods.   In  MOPAC  all  sorts  of  weird and wonderful systems are
   calculated, systems the authors of the convergers never  dreamed  of.
   MOPAC  uses a combination of all three convergers at times.  Normally
   only a quadratic damper is used.
 
        If this message appears,  suspect  first  that  the  calculation
   might be faulty, then, if you feel confident, try altering the SHIFT,
   or involking PULAY or CAMP-KING on their own.
 
        If nothing works, then consider slackening  the  SCF  criterion.
   This  will  allow heats of formation to be calculated with reasonable
   precision, but the gradients are likely to be imprecise.

               GEOMETRY TOO UNSTABLE FOR EXTRAPOLATION..
 
        In a reaction path calculation the initial geometry for a  point
   is  calculated  by  quadratic  extrapolation using the previous three
   points.
 
        If a quadratic fit is likely to lead to  an  inferior  geometry,
   then  the  geometry  of  the last point calculated will be used.  The
   total effect is to slow down the calculation, but no user  action  is
   recommended.
 
                  ** GRADIENT IS TOO LARGE TO ALLOW...
 
        Before a FORCE calculation can be performed  the  gradient  norm
   must be so small that the third and higher order components of energy
   in  the  force  field  are  negligible.   If,  in  the  system  under
   examination,  the  gradient norm is too large, the gradient norm will
   first be reduced using FLEPO, unless LET has been specified.  In some
   cases the FORCE calculation may be run only to decide if a state is a
   ground state or a transition state, in which case  the  results  have
   only  two  interpretations.   Under  these  circumstances, LET may be
   warranted.
 
                        GRADIENT IS VERY LARGE...
 
        In a calculation of the thermodynamic properties of the  system,
   if  the rotation and translation vibrations are non-zero, as would be
   the  case  if  the  gradient  norm  was   significant,   then   these
   "vibrations"  would  interfere with the low-lying genuine vibrations.
   The  criteria  for  THERMO  are  much  more  stringent  than  for   a
   vibrational  frequency  calculation,  as it is the lowest few genuine
   vibrations that determine the internal vibrational  energy,  entropy,
   etc.

        This is an error message.  For the D.F.P.  geometry optimization
   to  work  efficiently  the  gradient  norm must not rise very much on
   making  a  small  displacement  to  the  geometry  in  the  direction
   calculated  to reduce the gradient norm.  If this happens, then there
   is a finite chance that the D.F.P.  will fail to give  good  results.
   Normally  the  cause  of the error is a badly specified geometry, and
   information is printed to allow the user to correct  the  fault.   If
   the  user  is  satisfied  that  there  is no fault, then the key-word
   "GEO-OK" will allow the calculation to proceed, but great  care  must
   then  be  taken  in  insuring  that the results are satisfactory.  In
   particular, verify that the gradients have been reduced to about zero
   by the D.F.P.  at the end of the calculation.

            INTERNAL COORDINATES READ IN, AND CALCULATION...
 
        If internal coordinates are read in, but the calculation  is  to
   be  carried out using cartesian coordinates, then either all possible
   geometric variables must be optimized, or none can be optimized.   If
   only  some  are  marked for optimization, then ambiguity exists.  For
   example, if the bond-length of atom 6 is marked for optimization, but
   the  angle  is not, then when the conversion to cartesian coordinates
   takes place, the first coordinate becomes the "X" coordinate and  the
   second  the  "Y"  coordinate.  These bear no relationship to the bond
   length or angle.  This is a fatal error.
 
             INTERNAL COORDINATES READ IN, AND SYMMETRY...
 
        If internal coordinates are read in, but the calculation  is  to
   be  carried  out  using  cartesian  coordinates,  then  any  symmetry
   relationships between the internal coordinates will not be  reflected
   in  the  cartesian  coordinates.  For example, if the bond-lengths of
   atoms 5 and 6 are equal, it does not follow  that  these  atoms  have
   equal values for their "X" coordinates.  This is a fatal error.
 
                         JOB STOPPED BY OPERATOR
 
        Any MOPAC calculation, for which the SHUTDOWN command works, can
   be  stopped  by a user who issues the command "$SHUT <filename>, from
   the directory which contains <filename>.DAT
 
        MOPAC will then stop the calculation  at  the  first  convenient
   point,  usually after the current cycle has finished.  A restart file
   will be written and the job ended.  The message will  be  printed  as
   soon  as  it  is  detected,  which  would  be the next time the timer
   routine is accessed.
 
              THE LINE MINIMISATION FAILED TWICE IN A ROW
 
        This is usually found in more  exotic  calculations.   For  some
   reason,  the  heat  of  formation at the start of a line minimization
   within FLEPO was lower than any point on  the  line  minimization,  a
   situation that cannot occur naturally.
 
        Look at the gradient, if printed.  If it  is  acceptably  small,
   ignore  the message.  The gradient will not be printed if it was very
   small:  less than 2.0.  The time to worry is when the  gradient  norm
   is larger than, say, 20:  if larger than 50 something is badly wrong,
   and you should then suspect MOPAC is faulty in some way.

                      NO POINT LOWER IN ENERGY ...
 
        This  is  a  non-fatal  error  message,  caused  by  the  Powell
   line-search  routine in the D.F.P.  failing to lower the energy.  Two
   explanations are possible:  first, the geometry might be almost fully
   optimized,  in  which  case  the  smallest  step possible in the line
   search is  still  too  big;   and  second,  the  calculated  heat  of
   formation  of  a  previous  step  was  too  low.   This  would  be an
   algorithmic error.
 
        This error message occurs rarely in routine use, but can  easily
   be  induced  if  program  parameters  such  as  the SCF criterion are
   altered.
 
                NUMBER OF PARTICLES, nn GREATER THAN...
 
        When user-defined  microstates  are  not  used,  the  MECI  will
   calculate  all  possible  microstates that satisfy the space and spin
   constraints  imposed.   This  is  done  in  PERM,  which  permutes  N
   electrons  in  M  levels.   If  N is greater than M, then no possible
   permutation is valid.  This is not a fatal error - the  program  will
   continue to run, but no C.I.  will be done.
 
               NUMBER OF PERMUTATIONS TOO GREAT, LIMIT 60
 
        The number of permutations  of  alpha  or  beta  microstates  is
   limited to 60.  Thus if 3 alpha electrons are permuted among 5 M.O.s,
   that will generate 10 = 5!/(3!*2!) alpha  microstates,  which  is  an
   allowed  number.   However  if 4 alpha electrons are permuted among 8
   M.O.s, then 70 alpha microstates result and the arrays  defined  will
   be  insufficient.   Note  that  60 alpha and 60 beta microstates will
   permit 3600 microstates in all, which should be more than  sufficient
   for  most  purposes.   (An  exception  would  be  for excited radical
   icosohedral systems.)
 
                    SINCE COS HAS JUST BEEN RESET...
 
        A non-fatal error message.  After two attempts to lower the heat
   of formation have failed, the D.F.P.  optimization is terminated.  If
   the  gradients  are  acceptable,  no  further  action  is  necessary;
   otherwise  examine the geometry to see if a more reasonable numbering
   system can be made.
 
        A rarer cause of this message is when the geometry  supplied  is
   already  almost  fully optimized, and it becomes optimized within the
   first cycle.

             SYMMETRY SPECIFIED, BUT CANNOT BE USED IN DRC
 
        This is  self  explanatory.   The  DRC  requires  all  geometric
   constraints  to  be  lifted.   Any symmetry constraints will first be
   applied, to symmetrize the geometry, and then removed  to  allow  the
   calculation to proceed.
 
                SYSTEM DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE OPTIMISABLE
 
        This is a gradient norm minimization  message.   These  routines
   will  only  work  if  the nearest minimum to the supplied geometry in
   gradient-norm  space  is  a  transition  state  or  a  ground  state.
   Gradient  norm  space can be visualized as the space of the scalar of
   the derivative of the energy space with respect to  geometry.   To  a
   first  approximation, there are twice as many minima in gradient norm
   space as there are in energy space.
 
        It is unlikely that there exists any  simple  way  to  refine  a
   geometry  that results in this message.  While it is appreciated that
   a large amount of  effort  has  probably  already  been  expended  in
   getting  to  this point, users should steel themselves to writing off
   the whole geometry.  It is not recommended that  a  minor  change  be
   made to the geometry and the job re-submitted.
 
                  TEMPERATURE RANGE STARTS TOO LOW,...
 
        The thermodynamics  calculation  assumes  that  the  statistical
   summations  can  be  replaced  by integrals.  This assumption is only
   valid above 100K, so the lower temperature bound is set to  100,  and
   the calculation continued.
 
                     THERE HAVE BEEN 3 ATTEMPTS...
 
        In FLEPO, the energy minimization routine, three  attempts  have
   been  made to lower the heat of formation, and thus the gradient, but
   while the heat of formation has reached a fairly constant value,  the
   gradient  norm is still large.  This is a non-fatal error, and almost
   certainly  the  results  will  be  useful.   Try  using   "XYZ",   or
   re-arranging the connectivity.

                  THREE ATOMS BEING USED TO DEFINE....
 
        If the cartesian coordinates of an atom depend on  the  dihedral
   angle  it makes with three other atoms, and those three atoms fall in
   an almost straight  line,  then  a  small  change  in  the  cartesian
   coordinates  of  one of those three atoms can cause a large change in
   its position.  This is a potential source of trouble,  and  the  data
   should  be changed to make the geometric specification of the atom in
   question less ambiguous.
 
        This message can appear at any time,  particularly  in  reaction
   path and saddle-point calculations.
 
        An exception to this rule is if the three  atoms  fall  into  an
   exactly  straight  line.   For example, if, in propyne, the hydrogens
   are defined in terms of the three carbon atoms, then no error will be
   flagged.   In such a system the three atoms in the straight line must
   not have the angle between them optimized, as the finite step in  the
   derivative  calculation would displace one atom off the straight line
   and the error-trap would take effect.
 
        Correction  involves  re-defining  the  connectivity.   LET  and
   GEO-OK will not allow the calculation to proceed.

        Don't pay too much attention to  this  message.   Thermodynamics
   calculations  require  a  higher precision than vibrational frequency
   calculations.  In particular, the gradient norm should be very small.
   However,  it  is frequently not practical to reduce the gradient norm
   further, and to  date  no-one  has  determined  just  how  slack  the

        Triatomics are, by definition,  defined  in  terms  of  internal

   cartesian and internal coordinates are the same.   For  tetra-atomics
   and   higher,  the  presence  or  absence  of  a  connectivity  table
   distinguishes internal and cartesian coordinates, but for  triatomics
   there  is  an  ambiguity.  To resolve this, cartesian coordinates are
   not allowed for the data input for triatomics.

        MOPAC uses various criteria which control the precision  of  its
   stages.   These  criteria  are  chosen as the best compromise between
   speed and acceptable errors in the results.  The  user  can  override
   the  default  settings  by use of key-words;  however, care should be
   exercised as increasing a criterion can introduce the  potential  for
   infinite loops, and decreasing a criterion can result in unacceptably
   imprecise results.  These are usually characterized by 'noise'  in  a
   reaction  path, or large values for the trivial vibrations in a force
   calculation.

                               CHAPTER 10
 
                               DEBUGGING
 
 
 
        There are three potential sources of difficulty in using  MOPAC,
   each of which requires special attention.  There can be problems with
   data, due to errors in the data, or MOPAC may be called  upon  to  do
   calculations  for  which  it  was  not designed.  There are intrinsic
   errors in MOPAC which extensive testing has  not  yet  revealed,  but
   which a user's novel calculation uncovers.  Finally there can be bugs
   introduced by the user modifying MOPAC, either to make it  compatible
   with the host computer, or to implement local features.
 
        For whatever reason, the user may need to have  access  to  more
   information  than the normal key-words can provide, and a second set,
   specifically  for  debugging,  is  provided.   These  key-words  give
   information  about  the working of individual subroutines, and do not
   affect the course of the calculation.

   NOTES
 
   1.  These key words are activated by the  key-word  DEBUG.   Thus  if
       DEBUG  and  FOCK  are  both specified, every Fock matrix on every
       iteration will be printed.
 
   2.  DEBUG is not intended to increase  the  output,  but  does  allow
       other key-words to have a special meaning.
 
   3.  PULAY is  already  a  key-word,  so  DEBUGPULAY  was  an  obvious
       alternative.
 
   4.  PL initiates the output of the value of  the  largest  difference
       between  any  two  density  matrix  elements  on  two consecutive
       iterations.  This is very useful when investigating  options  for
       increasing the rate of convergance of the SCF calculation.
 
 
                 SUGGESTED PROCEDURE FOR LOCATING BUGS
 
        Users are supplied with the source code for  MOPAC,  and,  while
   the  original  code  is  fairly  bug-free, after it has been modified
   there is a possibility that bugs may have been introduced.  In  these
   circumstances  the author of the changes is obviously responsible for
   removing the offending bug,  and  the  following  ideas  might  prove
   useful in this context.
 
        First of all, and most important, before any  modifications  are
   done  a back-up copy of the standard MOPAC should be made.  This will
   prove invaluable in pinpointing deviations from the standard working.
   This  point  cannot  be  over-emphasized  -  MAKE  A  BACK-UP  BEFORE
   MODIFYING MOPAC!!!!
 
        Clearly, a bug can occur almost anywhere, and a  logical  search
   sequence  is  necessary in order to minimize the time taken to locate
   it.
 
        If possible, perform the debugging with  a  small  molecule,  in
   order  to  save time (debugging is, of necessity, time consuming) and
   to minimize output.
 
        The two sets of subroutines in MOPAC, those  involved  with  the
   electronics  and  those involved in the geometrics, are kept strictly
   separate, so the first question to be answered is which set  contains
                                  10-2
 
 
                               DEBUGGING
 
 
   the bug.  If the heats of formation, derivatives, I.P.s, and charges,
   etc., are correct, the bug lies in the geometrics;  if faulty, in the
   electronics.
 
        Bug in the Electronics Subroutines.
 
        Use  formaldehyde  for  this  test.   The   supplied   data-file
   MNRSD1.DAT  could  be  used  as  a  template for this operation.  Use
   key-words 1SCF, DEBUG, and any others necessary.
 
        The main steps are:
 
        (1) Check the  starting  one-electron  matrix  and  two-electron
   integral string, using the key-word HCORE.  It is normally sufficient
   to verify that the two hydrogen atoms are equivalent, and that the pi
   system  involves  only  pz on oxygen and carbon.  Note that numerical
   values are not checked, but only relative values.
 
        If  an  error  is  found,  use  MOLDAT  to  verify  the  orbital
   character, etc.
 
        If faulty the error lies in READ, GETGEO or MOLDAT.
 
        Otherwise the error lies in HCORE, H1ELEC or ROTATE.
 
        If the starting matrices are correct, go on to step (2).
 
        (2) Check the density or Fock matrix on  every  iteration,  with
   the words FOCK or DENSITY.  Check the equivalence of the two hydrogen
   atoms, and the pi system, as in (1).
 
        If an error is found, check the first Fock matrix.   If  faulty,
   the  bug  lies  in  ITER,  probably  in the Fock subroutines FOCK1 or
   FOCK2.  or in the (guessed) density matrix (MOLDAT).  An exception is
   in  the  UHF  closed-shell  calculation,  where  a small asymmetry is
   introduced to initiate the separation  of  the  alpha  and  beta  UHF
   wavefunctions.
 
        If no error is found, check the second Fock matrix.  If  faulty,
   the  error  lies in the density matrix DENSIT, or the diagonalization
   HQRII.
 
        If the Fock matrix is acceptable, check all the  Fock  matrices.
   If  the error starts in iterations 2 to 4, the error probably lies in
   CNVG, if after that, in PULAY, if used.
 
        If SCF is achieved, and the heat of formation is  faulty,  check
   HELECT.  If C.I.  was used check MECI.
 
        If the derivatives are faulty, use DCART to verify the cartesian
   derivatives.   If these are faulty, check DCART and DHC.  If they are
   correct,  or  not  calculated,  check  the  DERIV  finite  difference
   calculation.
 
 
 
                                  10-3
 
 
                               DEBUGGING
 
 
        If the geometric calculation is faulty, use FLEPO and LINMIN  to
   monitor the optimization, DERIV may also be useful here.
 
        For the  FORCE  calculation,  DCART  or  DERIV  are  useful  for
   variationally   optimized  functions,  COMPFG  for  non-variationally
   optimized functions.
 
        For reaction paths, verify that FLEPO is working correctly;   if
   so, then PATHS is faulty.
 
        For saddle-point calculations,  verify  that  FLEPO  is  working
   correctly;  if so, then REACT1 is faulty.
 
        Keep in mind the fact that MOPAC is  a  large  calculation,  and
   while intended to be versatile, many combinations of options have not
   been tested.  If  a  bug  is  found  in  the  original  code,  please
   communicate  details  to  the Academy, to Dr.  James J.  P.  Stewart,
   FJSRL, USAFA, Colorado Springs, CO 80840

                            INSTALLING MOPAC
 
 
 
        MOPAC is distributed on a magnetic tape as a set  of  FORTRAN-77
   files, along with ancillary documents such as command, help, data and
   results files.  The format of the tape  is  that  of  the  VAX-11/780
   computer.   The  following  instructions apply only to users with VAX
   computers:  users  with  other  machines  should  use  the  following
   instructions as a guide to getting MOPAC up and running.
 
   1.  Put the magnetic tape on the tape drive, write protected.
 
   2.  Allocate the tape drive with a command such as $ALLOCATE MTA0:
 
   3.  Go into an empty directory which is to hold MOPAC
 
   4.  Mount the magnetic tape with the command $MOUNT MTA0:  MOPAC
 
   5.  Copy all the files from the tape with the command
 
            $COPY MTA0:*.* *
 
 
        A useful operation after this would be to make a  hard  copy  of
   the  directory.   You  should now have the following sets of files in
   the directory:
 
   1.  A set of FORTRAN-77 files, see Appendix 1.
 
   2.  The command files COMPILE, MOPACCOM, MOPAC, and RMOPAC.
 
   3.  A file, MOPAC.OPT, which lists all the  object  modules  used  by
       MOPAC.
 
   4.  A help file called MOPAC.HLP.
 
   5.  A text file MOPAC.MAN.
 
   6.  Some test-data files, and results files.
 
 
 
 
 
                                  11-1
 
 
 
 
 
                            INSTALLING MOPAC
 
 
                       STRUCTURE OF COMMAND FILES
                                COMPILE
 
        The  parameter  file  DIMSIZES.DAT  should  be  read   and,   if
   necessary, modified before COMPILE is run.
 
 
                       DO NOT RUN COMPILE AT THIS TIME!!
 
        COMPILE should be run once only.  It assigns  DIMSIZES.DAT,  the
   block  of  FORTRAN  which  contains  the PARAMETERS for the dimension
   sizes to the logical name "SIZES".  This is a  temporary  assignment,
   but the user is strongly recommended to make it permanent by suitably
   modifying LOGIN file(s).
 
        All the FORTRAN files are then compiled, using the  array  sizes
   given  in  DIMSIZES.DAT:   these should be modified before COMPILE is
   run.  If, for whatever reason, DIMSIZES.DAT needs to be changed, then
   COMPILE   should  be  re-run,  as  modules  compiled  with  different
   DIMSIZES.DAT will be incompatible.
 
        The two parameters within DIMSIZES.DAT that the user can  modify
   are  MAXLIT  and  MAXHEV.   MAXLIT  is  assigned a value equal to the
   largest number of hydrogen atoms that a MOPAC job is expected to run,
   MAXHEV  is  assigned the corresponding number of heavy (non-hydrogen)
   atoms.  The ratio of light to heavy atoms should  not  be  less  than
   1/2.   Some  molecular orbital eigenvector arrays are overlapped with
   Hessian arrays, and to prevent compilation time error  messages,  the
   number of allowed A.O.s must be greater than, or equal to three times
   the number of allowed real atoms.
 
        This  operation  takes  about  7  minutes,  and  should  be  run
   "on-line", as a question and answer session is involved.
 
        When everything is successfully compiled, the object files  will
   then  be  assembled  into an executable image called MOPAC.EXE.  Once
   the image exists, there is no reason to keep the object files, and if
   space is at a premium these can be deleted at this time.
 
        In order for users to have access to MOPAC they must  insert  in
   their individual LOGIN.COM files the line
                      $@ <Mopac-directory>MOPACCOM
 
        where <Mopac-directory> is the name of the  disk  and  directory
   which holds all the MOPAC files.  For example, DRA0:[MOPAC], thus
                          $@ DRA0:[MOPAC]MOPAC
 
        MOPACCOM.COM  should  be  modified  once  to  accomodate   local
   definitions  of  the  directory  which is to hold MOPAC.  This change
   must also be made to RMOPAC.COM and to MOPAC.COM.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                  11-2
 
 
 
 
 
                                 MOPAC
 
        This command file submits a MOPAC job to a  queue.   Before  use
   MOPAC.COM  should  be  modified to suit local conditions.  The user's
   VAX is assumed to  run  three  queues,  called  QUEUE3,  QUEUE2,  and
   QUEUE1.   The  user  should  substitute  the  actual names of the VAX
   queues for these symbolic names.  Thus, for  example,  if  the  local
   names  of  the  queues  are "TWELVEHOUR", for jobs of length up to 12
   hours, "ONEHOUR", for jobs of less than one hour,  and  "30MINS"  for
   quick  jobs,  then  in  place of "QUEUE3", "QUEUE2", and "QUEUE1" the
   words "TWELVEHOUR", "ONEHOUR", and "30MINS" should be inserted.
                                 RMOPAC
 
        RMOPAC is the command file for running MOPAC.   It  assigns  all
   the data files that MOPAC uses to the channels.  If the user wants to
   use other file-name endings than those  supplied,  the  modifications
   should be made to RMOPAC.
 
        A recommended sequence of operations to get MOPAC up and running
   would be:
 
   1.  Modify the file DIMSIZES.DAT.  The default  sizes  are  20  heavy
       atoms and 20 light atoms.
 
   2.  Read through the COMMAND files to familiarize yourself with  what
       is being done.
 
   3.  Edit the file MOPAC.COM to use the local queue names.
 
   4.  Edit the file  RMOPAC.COM  if  the  default  file-names  are  not
       acceptable.
 
   5.  Edit MOPACCOM.COM  to  assign  MOPACDIRECTORY  to  the  disk  and
       directory which will hold MOPAC.
 
   6.  Edit the individual LOGIN.COM files to insert the following line
                      $@ <Mopac-directory>MOPACCOM
       Note that MOPACDIRECTORY cannot be used,  as  the  definition  of
       MOPACDIRECTORY is made in MOPACCOM.COM
 
   7.  Execute the modified LOGIN command so that the new  commands  are
       effective.
 
   8.  Run COMPILE.COM.  This takes about 8 minutes to execute.
 
   9.  Enter the command
       $MOPAC
             You will receive the message
        "What file? :"
             to which the reply should be the actual data-file name. For
             example, "MNRSD1", the file is assumed to end in .DAT,
             e.g. MNRSD1.DAT.
             You will then be prompted for the queue:
        "What queue? :"
           Any queue defined in MOPAC.COM will suffice:
        "SYS$BATCH"
                                  11-3
 
 
 
 
 
           Finally, the priority will be requested:
        "What priority? [5]:"
           To which any value between 1 and 5 will suffice. Note that the
        maximum priority is limited by the system (manager).
 
 
 
 
        To  familiarize  yourself  with  the   system,   the   following
   operations might be useful.
 
   1.  Run the (supplied) test  molecules,  and  verify  that  MOPAC  is
       producing "acceptable" results.
 
   2.  Make some simple modifications to the datafiles supplied in order
       to test your understanding of the data format
 
   3.  When satisfied that MOPAC is working, and that data files can  be
       made, begin production runs.
 
 
        Working of SHUTDOWN command
 
        If, for whatever reason, a run needs to be stopped  prematurely,
   the  command  $SHUT  <jobnumber>  can be issued.  This will execute a
   small command-language file, which copies the data-file to form a new
   file called <filename>.END
 
        The next time MOPAC calls function SECOND,  the  presence  of  a
   readable    file   called   SHUTDOWN,   logically   identified   with
   <filename>.END, is checked  for,  and  if  it  exists,  the  apparent
   elapsed  CPU  time  is  increased by 1,000,000 seconds, and a warning
   message issued.  No further action is taken until the elapsed time is
   checked  to see if enough time remains to do another cycle.  Since an
   apparently very long time has been used, there  is  not  enough  time
   left to do another cycle, and the restart files are generated and the
   run stopped.
 
        SHUTDOWN  is  completely  machine  -  independent,   and   works
   successfully  on  the  Academy's GOULD and Data General computers, in
   addition to the three VAX 11-780 machines.

        Instructions to convert MOPAC to run on Data General Computers
                                _____
 
 
 
        (a) Modification of the FORTRAN code.
 
   1.  Conversion of the INCLUDE statement.
 
            In MOPAC the non-FORTRAN77 statement INCLUDE 'SIZES'  occurs
       very  often.   This  statement  is  VAX  specific, the equivalent
       statement in Data-General FORTRAN77 is of form
        INCLUDE ':UDD:directoryname:filename'
       where directoryname is the name of the directory which is to hold
       MOPAC,  and  filename  is the file which holds the parameters (in
       VAX files this would be DIMSIZES.DAT).  The  first  global  edit,
       therefore, is to replace every occurance of 'SIZES' with the name
       of the Data-General file.  An alternative, for users who  have  a
       limited  editor,  is  to  name  the  file  which  is  to hold the
       parameters SIZES;  this avoids the need to make  this  particular
       edit.
 
   2.  Channel Numbers.
 
            The default channel numbers allocated  by  the  Data-General
       linker  are not suitable;  channel 10, for example, is defined as
       FORMATTED, while in MOPAC it is UNFORMATTED.  Every channel  used
       must be explicitely defined.  The full definitions suggested are:
 
       1.  Channel 5 - Input.  In  Subroutine  READ,  before  the  first
           executable statement, insert the line:
                 OPEN(UNIT=5,FILE='INPUT',RECFM='DATASENSITIVE',PAD='YES')
 
       2.  Channel 6 - Output.  In  Subroutine  READ,  also  before  the
           first executable statement, insert the line:
                 OPEN(UNIT=6,FILE='OUTPUT',RECFM='DATASENSITIVE')
 
       3.  Channel 9 - Restart.  In  each  of  the  subroutines  DFPSAV,
           PARSAV,  and  FORSAV,  before the first executable statement,
           insert the lines:
                 OPEN(UNIT=9,FILE='RESTART',ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL',RECFM='DYNAMIC',
                +FORM='UNFORMATTED')
 
       4.  Channel 10 - Density.  In each  of  the  subroutines  DFPSAV,
           PARSAV,  and  FORSAV,  before the first executable statement,
           insert the lines:
                 OPEN(UNIT=10,FILE='DENSITY',ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL',RECFM='DYNAMIC'
                +FORM='UNFORMATTED')
 
       5.  Channel 12 - Archive.  In Subroutine WRITE, before the  first
           executable statement, insert the line
                 OPEN(UNIT=12,FILE='ARCHIVE',RECFM='DATASENSITIVE')
 
 
            Ideally, some of the parameters specified could be  omitted,
       but in practice they were found necessary.

   3.  Timing Routines.  There are two of these, one for CPU seconds and
       another to allow the date to be printed.
 
            At the end of Function SECOND there is  a  large  amount  of
       VAX-specific code which handles the call for CPU seconds.  Remove
       all this code, and replace SECOND with:
             FUNCTION SECOND()
             DIMENSION IAC(4)
             ISYS_RUNTM=24
             IAC0=-1
             IAC1=0
             IAC2=WORDADDR(IAC)
             IER=ISYS(ISYS_RUNTM,IAC0,IAC1,IAC2)
             SECOND=0.001*IAC(2)
             RETURN
             END
 
            In Subroutine WRITE is a call to  DATE,  which  returns  the
       current date.  In VAX code, the argument IDATE was CHARACTER9, in
       DG code, replace this type specification with DIMENSION IDATE(3),
       and the WRITE statement that prints the date with:
             WRITE(6,'(60X,I2,''/'',I2,''/'',I2)')IDATE(2),IDATE(3),IDATE(1)-190
 
            A second replacement is necessary  further  down  in  WRITE,
       when  the  ARCHIVE  file  is  being written.  This write could be
       replaced with
             WRITE(IWRITE,'(60X,I2,''/'',I2,''/'',I2)')IDATE(2),
            +IDATE(3),IDATE(1)-1900
 
 
 
 
 
        (b) Modification of the COMMAND files.
 
 
        Two COMMAND files are needed;  these are the DG  equivalents  of
   the VAX files MOPAC.COM and RMOPAC.COM.  They can be called MOPAC.CLI
   and RMOPAC.CLI.

   1.  Timing Routines.  There are two of these, one for CPU seconds and
       another  to  allow  the  date  to  be printed.  The VAX-specifiic

       GOULD-specific code.  xxxxx

        One COMMAND file is needed, this is the GOULD equivalent of  the
   VAX file RMOPAC.COM, it can be called "domopac".

   How to use MOPAC
 
        The COM file to run the new program can be  accessed  using  the
   command  "MOPAC"  followed  by  none, one or two arguments.  Possible
   options are:
   MOPAC   MYDATAFILE 120  4
   MOPAC   MYDATAFILE 120
   MOPAC   MYDATAFILE
   In the latter case it is assumed that  the  shortest  queue  will  be
   adequate.
 
   MOPAC
 
        In this case you will be prompted for the datafile, and then for
   the  queue.  Restarts should be user transparent.  If MOPAC does make
   any restart files, do not change them (It would be hard to do anyhow,
   as  they're  in  machine  code),  as they will be used when you run a
   RESTART job.  The main files that are produced are:
       <filename>.OUT    Results
        <filename>.ARC    Archive or summary
        <filename>.RES    Restart
        <filename>.DEN    Density matrix (in binary)
        <filename>.GPT    Data for program DENSITY (in binary)

                             SHORT VERSION
 
        For various reasons it might not be practical  to  assemble  the
   entire  MOPAC  program.   For  example, your computer may have memory
   limitations, or you may have very large systems to be  run,  or  some
   options  may  never  be  wanted.   For  whatever reason, if using the
   entire program is undesirable, an abbreviated  version,  which  lacks
   the  full  range of options of the whole program, can be specified at
   compile time.
 
        At the bottom of the DIMSIZES.DAT file the programmer  is  asked
   which  of  two options is to be used in compiling.  One option allows
   the arrays of MECI and PULAY to assume their correct size, the  other
   option  contracts  them  to a minimal value.  This latter option thus
   saves a lot of address space, and MOPAC will be considerably  reduced
   in size.
 
        As long as no attempt is made to use  the  reduced  subroutines,
   the  program will function normally.  If an attempt is made to use an
   option which has been excluded then the program will error.

                             Size of MOPAC
 
        As MOPAC is intended to fit into any computer of more than  500K
   addressable  memory, it can assume almost any size desired.  However,
   it is useful for programmers to have an idea  of  how  large  various
   portions are, and the following data might prove useful.

                  DESCRIPTION OF SUBROUTINES IN MOPAC
 
 
     row-vector, usually eigenvectors and eigenvalues.  The indices
 
     printed depend on the size of the matrix:  they can be either

     orbitals, vibrational modes are over numbers.  Called by WRITE,
 
     FORCE.
 
MECI Main sequence:  Main function for Configuration Interaction,
 
     MECI constructs the appropriate C.I.  matrix, and evaluates the

     READ, then calls either FLEPO to do geometry optimization,
 
     FORCE to do a FORCE calculation, PATHS for a reaction with a
 
     supplied coordinate, NLLSQ for a gradient minimization or
 
     REACT1 for locating the transition state.  Starts the timer.

     else.  Called by WRITE
 
PULAY Utility:  A new converger.  Uses a powerful
 
     mathematical non-iterative method for obtaining the SCF Fock
 
     matrix.  Principle is that at SCF the eigenvectors of the Fock
 
     and density matrices are identical, so [F.P] is a measure of
 
     the non-self consistency.  While very powerful, PULAY is not
 
     universally applicable.  Used by ITER.
 
REACT1 Main sequence:  Uses reactants and products to find the
 
     transition state.  A hypersphere of N dimensions is centered on
 
     each moiety, and the radius steadily reduced.  The entity of

     hold the calculated integrals.  Called by ROTATE only.
 
ROTATE Utility:  All the two-electron repulsion integrals, the electron-
 
     nuclear attraction integrals, and the nuclear-nuclear repulsion
 
     term between two atoms are calculated here.  Typically 100 two-
 
     electron integrals are evaluated.
 
SEARCH Utility:  Part of the SIGMA gradient minimization.

     minimum and calculates the second derivative of the energy
 
     in the search direction.  Called by POWSQ.
 
SECOND Utility:  Contains VAX specific code.  Function SECOND
 
     returns the number of CPU seconds elapsed since an arbitrary
 
     starting time.  If the SHUTDOWN command has been issued,
 
     the CPU time is in error by exactly 1,000,000 seconds, and
 
     the job usually terminates with the message "time exceeded".

     M.O.  is filled.  Called by ITER only.
 
SYMTRY Utility:  Calculates values for geometric parameters from known
 
     geometric parameters and symmetry data.  Called whenever GMETRY
 
     is called.

     calculated, THERMO calculates thermodynamic quantities such as
 
     internal energy, heat capacity, entropy, etc, for translational,
 
     vibrational, and rotational, degrees of freedom.
 
VECPRT Utility:  Prints out a packed, lower-half triangular matrix.

                   DIFFERENCES FROM EARLIER VERSIONS
 
 
 
 
 
                       Differences from Version 1
                       ___________ ____ _______ _
 
 
     After the first version of MOPAC was  submitted  to  QCPE,  several
modifications were made.  These can be divided into three main groups,
 (a) Rectification of actual errors in the code that
     were giving rise to incorrect results.
 (b) Correction of errors in the code that caused MOPAC to crash.
 (c) Enhancements to the code to allow more flexibility.
 
     In addition, a large number of very minor changes were made.  These
are too numerous to document;  suffice it to say that they were designed
to make MOPAC more robust and  bug-free.   An  example  is  that,  if  a
triatomic  system  was  run in a C.I.  mode, BIRADICAL for example, then
the titling of the C.I.  matrix was faulty.  Obviously these bugs  could
be  lived  with,  but  they are an irritation, and where found have been
removed.
 
     As the actual errors are by far the  most  serious,  they  will  be
described first, in order:  error, effect, rectification.
              Actual Errors in MOPAC, Version 1,  QCPE 455
              ______ ______ __ ______ _______ __  ____ ___
 
     (1) In  a  SADDLE  or  reaction  path,  the  geometry  optimization
criterion  in  FLEPO  was  set  as a function of the reaction coordinate
gradient norm of the last point  calculated.   Sometimes  that  gradient
norm   rose   to  such  a  value  that  the  geometry  criterion  became
meaninglessly large.  In that circumstance, FLEPO  gave  a  very  poorly
optimized  geometry, and the resulting reaction coordinate gradient norm
is consequently very large.
 
     This was characterized in the output  by  all  the  gradient  norms
being very large.
 
     The fault was corrected by putting an upper bound on  the  gradient
criterion in FLEPO.
 
     (2)  Within  VALUE  the  force  constant  eigenvector  matrix   was
dimensioned  for  1000  elements,  equivalent  to  about  31  degrees of
freedom.  For larger  systems,  the  results  were  nonsense,  or  MOPAC
                                  D-1
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
crashed  due  to  faulty  addressing.   The  sizes of the eigenvalue and
eigenvector matrices are now functions of MAXHEV and MAXLIT.
 
     (3) If no SCF was obtained, the error message contained the  change
in  energy  at the end of ITER.  This was in fact the electronic energy.
The error message now prints the change in heat of formation of the last
two iterations.
 
     (4) The biradical C.I.  has been corrected.  The error in this  was
due  entirely  to  my over-enthusiasm.  When MOPAC was being written all
the theory was checked simultaneously.  I  found  what  looked  like  an
error  in  the  C.I.   theory,  and  "corrected"  it  without sufficient
confirmation of the fault.  The original formulation was correct.
 
     (5) In the output one set of  symmetry-dependent  coordinates  were
sometimes  in  error.  This was caused by the the derivative calculation
not re-setting the symmetry-dependent coordinates.  In particular, if  a
reaction   path   was   being  followed,  and  the  path  itself  was  a
symmetry-defining coordinate, then, while the  value  of  the  path  was
printed  correctly,  all  the dependent coordinates were out by 0.000001
Angstrom or radian.  This has been fixed.
               Errors that Caused MOPAC QCPE 455 to Crash
               ______ ____ ______ _____ ____ ___ __ _____
 
     (1) If the maximum size of  system  was  changed,  a  RESTART  file
created  by  one  run would not be accepted by the new executable.  This
was a result of some of the arrays being output having a size which  was
a  function of the MAXHEV and MAXLIT.  This dependency has been removed,
both in the RESTART and in some of the internal working, e.g., REACTION.
 
     (2) In a  reaction  path,  the  interpolation  procedure  sometimes
fails,  particularly  when very small steps are followed by large steps.
A simple check is now done to ensure that the interpolated  geometry  is
realistic.
                          Enhancements to MOPAC
                          ____________ __ _____
 
     (1) "d" Orbitals:  The  MNDO  Hamiltonian  within  MOPAC  has  been
extended,  so that when parameters are available for "d" orbitals, these
can be inserted directly into the block-data  files.   This  version  of
MOPAC does not have "d" orbital parameters in the block data.
 
 
     (2) Key-Word " XYZ":  Using internal coordinates  it  is  sometimes
very  difficult  to  define  the  two  geometries  required  in a SADDLE
calculation.  Another difficulty in SADDLE  is  that  quite  often  this
option  fails  to  produce results, usually when either the reactants or
the products falls over the transition state  into  the  valley  of  the
other  species.   This is mainly due to the use of internal coordinates.
" XYZ" allows the geometry part of the calculation to run  in  cartesian
coordinates.
 
     (3) In three subroutines, DENSIT, FOCK2 and  HQRII  the  arithmetic
quantity (I(I+1))/2 was evaluated very often;  this has been replaced by
a look-up array.  The saving in time is about 5%.
 
     (4) All coordinates are now output via GEOUT.   Both  internal  and
cartesian  can  now  be  handled by GEOUT.  If cartesian coordinates are
supplied to GEOUT, an internal coordinate description  is  set  up,  the
                                  D-2
 
 
 
connectivity being calculated "on-the-fly".
 
     (5) SHIFT was not enabled in QCPE-455.   If  SHIFT  was  used  with
half-electron  systems,  then  no SCF was obtained.  This was due to the
SCF  energy  changing  continuously  as  the  value  of  SHIFT  changed.
Subroutine ITER has been modified to allow all open shell systems to use
SHIFT.
 
     (6) Many of the internal constants have been  changed  slightly  in
light of experience.  No user-detectable differences should be caused by
this.  The main effect is to increase the internal  consistency  of  the
calculation;  that is, all tolerances should now be mutually compatible.
 
     (7) New key word ITRY:  Sometimes ITER fails to go SCF when with  a
few  extra  iteration  an SCF would be achieved.  In that case, ITRY=nnn
allows nnn iterations.  See definition of key-word ITRY.
 
     (8) When option  "PL"  is  in  force,  the  heat  of  formation  in
Kcal/mole at each iteration is now printed, along with the difference in
heats of formation between the last iteration and the current.
 
     (9) If SHIFT was in use then the  virtual  energy  levels  were  in
error,  by about 0.01eV.  The final Fock matrix was also affected.  This
has now been corrected by re-diagonalizing  an  un-modified  final  Fock
matrix.
 
     (10) The MAIN segment has  been  re-written  to  allow  POLAR,  the
polarization  calculation,  to  be  run  after  any of the main geometry
optimization paths have been run.  An exception is that POLAR cannot  be
run directly after NLLSQ has been run within FORCE.
 
     (11) The BLOCK DATA subroutine has been re-written  to  allow  easy
modification.  Various errors in MNDO are noted there, but should not be
 
corrected:  a warning to that effect is in the comment lines there.
 
     (12) The key-word "MULLIK" is made available.   MULLIK  will  cause
the Mulliken population analysis to be output.
 
     (13) The output during the working of  SIGMA  and  NLLSQ  has  been
brought  into line with that of FLEPO.  That is, each cycle is output on
one line, along with the current heat of  formation,  time,  time  left,
etc.
 
     (14) Whenever a run is stopped due to the time being exceeded,  the
output  file  now  contains a data file suitable for restarting the job.
This allows an alternative start-up to the key-word RESTART.
 
     (15) Tin has been added to MNDO.  Parameters given here  should  be
treated as provisional until the "official" values are published.  NOTE:
Tin parameters are not available for general release yet.
 
     (16) The key-word ECHO will cause  the  input  data  to  be  output
exactly as read in.  This is useful in debugging only.
 
 
 
                                  D-3
 
 
 
     (17) Subroutine READA has been modified to increase  the  precision
of   the   numbers  read  in.   Thus  180.0  will  now  be  rendered  as
180.000000000000 rather than 180.000000180000.
 
     (18) Sparkles have been put into MINDO/3.
 
     (19) MAJOR CHANGE TO DEFINITION OF I.P.  FOR RHF DOUBLETS!!
          _____ ______ __ __________ __ ____  ___ ___ __________
 
     The definition of RHF doublet I.P., not previously defined in MNDO,
is  now  defined  as  the  negative of the half-filled molecular orbital
energy plus one-half the coulomb integral <ii|ii>.
 
     (20) Bond angles, on output, are defined as lying in the range  0.0
to  180.0  degrees.  Negative angles, or angles greater than 180 degrees
are meaningless;  any that  are  generated  are  converted  into  angles
within  the  range 0 to 180 degress.  Note that restricting the angle to
this range may affect the dihedral angles.  Dihedral angles, on  output,
are   defined   as   lying   within   the   range   -179.9999999999  and
180.00000000000  degrees.   This  is  to  prevent  dihedrals   "winding"
themselves up, angles such as 456.7 degrees are obviously nonsense.

                       Differences from Version 2
                       ___________ ____ _______ _
 
     Far fewer  errors  were  found  in  Version  2;   however,  several
limitations  in  Version  2 were removed, and some quite large additions
made.  Rather than define each  change,  the  following  list  of  major
modifications is given.
 
     1.  A full configuration interaction calculation, called  MECI,  is
         provided.   This  general C.I.  replaces the two specific C.I.s
         allowed under Versions 1 and 2.
 
     2.  In Version 3  rudimentary  solid-state  capability,  to  handle
         polymers  only,  is  provided.   This is intended to be used in
         conjunction with MOSOL.
 
     3.  All possible non-standard FORTRAN-77 has been removed, so  that
         MOPAC  can  be easily transferred to any computer that supports
         the FORTRAN-77 standard.
 
     4.  Several new elements have been parameterized and inserted  into
         the BLOCK DATA file.
 
     5.  A powerful converger has been added.  This has  resulted  in  a
         considerable  reduction in the number of calculations that fail
         to go self-consistent.
 
     6.  The  ability  to  insert  parameters  for  newly  parameterized
         elements is provided.
 
     7.  A Dynamic Reaction Coordinate calculation  is  provided.   This
         allows the course of a reaction to be followed.
 
     8.  All gradients and gradient norms printed are now  correct.   In
         earlier  versions of MOPAC these quantities were too small by a
         factor of 2.0, i.e., they only had 50% of their correct value.
