MOPAC
======

MOPAC is a general-purpose semiempirical Molecular Orbital PACkage for the study of solid state and molecular structures and reactions.

The semi-empirical Hamiltonians MNDO and  MINDO/3  are  implemented,  and  calculations  of  vibrational spectra,  thermodynamic  quantities,  isotopic  substitution effects and force constants are combined in a fully integrated package.
